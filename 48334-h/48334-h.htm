<div class="sidenote">Accession
of Elizabeth.
Joy
of the Protestants.</div>

<p>The proclamation of Anne Boleyn&#8217;s daughter can hardly have
caused general satisfaction in Ireland, but it was hailed with
joy by Protestant officials whose prospects had been clouded
during the late reign. Old Sir John Alen was soon in Dublin,
whence he wrote to congratulate Cecil on his restoration to
office, and to remind him of his own sufferings under Queen
Mary. Thomas Alen, when reminding the new secretary of
his great losses, rejoiced that God had sent light after darkness,
and that he and his friends were going to have their
turn. A sharp eye, he said, should be kept on Sir Oswald
Massingberd, who was suspected of a design to pull down
Kilmainham, lest its beauty and convenience should again
attract the Lord Deputy. Massingberd should be sternly
restricted to his revenue of 1,000 marks, and the great seal
should be transferred to a lawyer of English birth. The
prior was so far successful that Kilmainham soon afterwards
ceased to be a royal residence. He probably sold the lead,
and the damage being aggravated by a great storm, the
commandery was not thought worth repairing, and the
chief governor&#8217;s abode was transferred to Dublin Castle. Sir
Ralph Bagenal, formerly lieutenant of Leix and Offaly, had
been dismissed for denying the Papal supremacy, and had
been forced to seek refuge in France, where he lived by selling
at a great sacrifice a property worth 500<i>l.</i> a year. Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Elizabeth gave him the non-residence fines of twelve bishoprics;
but there were legal obstacles, and he begged for something
more substantial. Staples, the deprived Bishop of
Meath, pointed out his griefs to Cecil, and thinking, no doubt,
more of the Queen than of his correspondent, complained that
Pole had made it a grievous article against him that he had
presumed to pray for the soul of his old master. Pole probably
hated Henry VIII. enough to wish his soul unprayed
for, but the complaint is a very odd one from a Protestant
divine.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The limitations
of
the Tyrone
Patent are
disputed.
Shane
O&#8217;Neill.</div>

<p>Sidney, whom most men spoke well of, was confirmed in
the office of Lord Justice, and had soon plenty of work in the
North. The old Earl of Tyrone was sinking fast, and the
horrors of a disputed succession were imminent. Henry VIII.
had conferred the Earldom on Con O&#8217;Neill for life, with
remainder to Matthew Ferdorogh O&#8217;Neill and his heirs male
for ever. The Barony of Dungannon was at the same time
conferred upon the remainder man, with a proviso that it
should descend upon the heir to the Earldom. Matthew&#8217;s
mother was Alison Kelly, and at the time of his birth she
was the wife of a smith at Dundalk. He was reputed to be
Kelly&#8217;s son until he was sixteen, when his mother presented
him to Con as his own child. &#8216;Being a gentleman,&#8217; said his
eldest son, &#8216;he never refused no child that any woman named to
be his,&#8217; and he accepted Matthew with a good grace. There
was a Celtic law or doctrine that a child born in adultery
should belong to its real father, but there is no evidence
to show that the rule was actually binding in Ulster in the
sixteenth century. Shane, the legitimate eldest son, made a
plain statement to the contrary, and illustrated it by an Irish
proverbial saying that a calf belongs to the owner of the
cow, and not to the owner of the bull. Matthew became a
good soldier, and Con was willing to have him for a successor.
But as Shane grew up he learned to oppose this arrangement,
and, having good abilities and boundless ambition, he was
designated by a great portion of the clan as successor to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
tribal sovereignty. Shane oppressed his father, and perhaps
ultimately induced him to acquiesce in the popular choice;
but to make all safe, he took the precaution of murdering the
Baron of Dungannon, whose prowess he had reason to remember,
and whom he had no wish to meet again in the
field. He steadily maintained that his victim was the smith&#8217;s
son, and no relation; but the Irish annalists lend him no
countenance, for they remark that the deed was &#8216;unbecoming
in a kinsman.&#8217; The Baron had left a young son, on whom
his title devolved, and the government were bound by the
patent to maintain his ultimate rights to the Earldom. It
is uncertain whether Henry VIII. knew that Matthew Ferdorogh
was born while his mother lived in wedlock with the
smith, but probably he may be acquitted of having encouraged
one of the worst Brehon doctrines.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Strength of
Shane&#8217;s
position.</div>

<p>Yet Shane&#8217;s case against the Government was a strong
one; for it was not disputed that his father had known the
facts, and he was thus able to contend that the King had
been deceived, and that the limitation in the patent was void.
Besides, it was asked, why was not the Earldom given in the
usual way to Con and his heirs male? Whether Shane knew
of the above-mentioned Brehon regulation or not, it was his
interest to affect ignorance, to represent both his father and
King Henry as the victims of deception, and to take his stand
on strict hereditary right for the title, and on tribal election
for his personal supremacy. About strict veracity he was no
more scrupulous than Queen Elizabeth herself. The dilemma
was complete, for English lawyers could not for very shame
deny the moral claims of the legitimate heir, nor could politicians
ignore those Irish captainries which the Crown had
acknowledged over and over again. By Celtic usage Con had
of course no power whatever to alienate or transmit the property
of the tribe: in that he had only a life interest. Shane
argued, moreover, that according to the law of the Pale no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
lands could pass by patent without an inquisition previously
taken. None could be taken in Tyrone, for it was no shire.
If the English law were followed, there was, therefore, no
power to divert the inheritance from him as rightful heir;
if the Irish law prevailed, then he threw himself on the
suffrages of the tribe.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney
visits
Shane
O&#8217;Neill.</div>

<p>Shane O&#8217;Neill robbed his father and mother of all they
possessed, and drove them into the Pale, where the unfortunate
Con died early in 1559. Shane, who had recovered
from his defeat by the O&#8217;Donnells, and secured himself by
assassination against his most dangerous rival, claimed both
the Earldom of Tyrone and the tribal sovereignty of the
North. At first the Queen was strongly inclined to admit
his pretensions. The patent was indeed fatal to them, but
Elizabeth had an eminently practical mind, and the fact that
Shane was in quiet possession weighed with her more than
his legitimacy. In the absence of positive orders, Sidney did
his best to maintain peace in the North. He repaired to
Dundalk, and summoned Shane to attend him. The wily
chief was loud in his professions of loyalty, but feared possible
loss of reputation among his own people, and refused to go.
Having less reason to regard appearances, Sidney visited
Shane in his camp, and consented to act as god-father to his
son, and to enter the mysteriously sacred bond of gossipred,
or compaternity. O&#8217;Neill bound himself to keep the peace
until the Queen should have pronounced on his claims, and
Sussex, who hated him, expressed a belief that he would not
keep his promise. Sidney could obtain nothing more, and
Shane&#8217;s arguments were indeed such as could not easily be
refuted.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Sussex struggled hard to avoid returning to the hated
Irish service, and pleaded occupations public and private.
He declared, with perfect truth, that Sidney would govern
Ireland much better than he could, and he was doubtless unwilling
to leave the field clear to Lord Robert Dudley. But
the Queen would take no denial, and he had to go. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
at this time inclined to govern Ireland in her father&#8217;s cheap
and rather otiose fashion, and the number of pardons granted
during her first years shows that she aimed at a reputation
for clemency. She understood the magnitude of the task
awaiting her in Ireland, but declared herself unable to spare
the necessary forces on account of the huge debt bequeathed
by her sister, and of the expensive legacy of a Scotch and
French war. The exchequer of Ireland had been much mismanaged,
and its reform was urged on the restored governor,
whose standing army was fixed at 1,500 men, 300 of them
horse and 300 kerne. He was authorised to spend 1,500<i>l.</i> a
month, but urged, if possible, to reduce the expense to 1,000<i>l.</i>
The amount either of men or money was not to be exceeded,
except under the pressure of necessity. The first duty of the
new Lord Deputy and his council was to set the service of
God before their eyes, and, pending a Parliamentary inquiry,
all English-born officials were, at least in their own houses,
to use the rites and ceremonies established in England.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of

<p>Sussex landed at or near Dalkey, and on the following
day rode into Dublin. He was received on St. Stephen&#8217;s
Green by the Mayor and Aldermen. Shaking hands with
the chief magistrate, the Earl is reported to have said, &#8216;You
be all happy, my masters, in a gracious queen.&#8217; Three days
later he was sworn in at Christ Church, Nicholas Darton, or
Dardy, one of the vicars-choral, chanting the Litany in
English before the ceremony, and the choir singing the
<i>Te Deum</i> in English afterwards. Ormonde at the same time
took the oath as a Privy Councillor and as Lord Treasurer of
Ireland. Thus was the Protestant ritual quietly re-introduced,
Sidney having been sworn with the full Roman ceremonial.

<div class="sidenote">The Queen

<p>Many important men had hastened to offer their services
and forward their petitions to the new Queen. Conspicuous
among them was Richard, second Earl of Clanricarde, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<i>Sassanagh</i>, or the Englishman, of whose loyalty the Queen
had a very good opinion, but who in one important respect
fell short even of a Court standard of morals. The names of
seven of his wives and sultanas have come down to us, and
of these at least five were living at this time. He was
acknowledged as captain of Connaught, his Earldom was confirmed
by patent, and he received other marks of favour.
The Queen also lent a favourable ear to Ormonde&#8217;s uncle,
brother, and cousin, and to the new Earl of Desmond.
Connor O&#8217;Brien, whom Sussex had established in the Earldom
of Thomond, and MacCarthy More, were also well treated,
and so were several of the corporate towns.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of 1560.
The royal
supremacy
restored.</div>

<p>The first Parliament of Elizabeth met on January 12,
1560, and was dissolved on February 1. It was attended by
three archbishops, seventeen bishops, and twenty-three temporal
peers, including all the earls then extant in Ireland.
Ten counties sent two knights each, and twenty-eight cities
and boroughs were represented by two burgesses each. Ten
other counties, King&#8217;s and Queen&#8217;s among them, are mentioned,
Connaught counting as one, and Down being divided
into two; but they either received no writs or made
no returns, and the same may be said of the borough of
Kilmallock. James Stanihurst, Recorder of Dublin and
member for that city, was chosen speaker. The chief business
was to establish the Queen&#8217;s title, and to restore her father&#8217;s
and brother&#8217;s ecclesiastical legislation. First-fruits were
restored to the Crown, and so was the commandery of St.
John. Massingberd&#8217;s alienations were annulled, and, as he
was suspected of secret dealings with the Irish, he was
attainted unless he should surrender within forty days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Variations
from the
Anglican
theory.</div>

<p>So far English legislation was closely followed, but in two
important respects the Church was made more dependent on
the State than in England. Royal Commissioners, or Parliament
in the last resort, were to be the judges of heresy
without reference to any synod or convocation, and <i>congés<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
d&#8217;élire</i> were abolished as useless and derogatory to the prerogative.
These matters having been arranged to his satisfaction,
Sussex again went to England, and Sir William
Fitzwilliam, who had just come over as Treasurer at War, was
appointed Lord Justice in his room.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Catholics
will

<p>Fitzwilliam, who was new to Ireland, at first found the
Irish pretty peaceful, but admitted that the overtaxed people
of the Pale were less so than they were bound in duty to be.
Causes of disturbance were not long in coming. Old O&#8217;Connor
escaped from Dublin Castle, and uneasiness was immediately
observable in the districts where he had influence. Calvagh
O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s wife, who was Argyle&#8217;s half-sister, had brought
over some 1,500 Scots, &#8216;not to her husband&#8217;s enrichment,&#8217;
as the Lord Justice supposed, but as a plague to Shane, who
had married O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s sister and ill-treated her. Shane had
engaged a similar force, and all these combustibles could
scarcely be stored without mischief. The priests who were
beaten in England showed signs of an intention to transfer
the struggle to Ireland, where they had many partisans and
might create more. At all events, they were flocking across
the Channel, &#8216;not for any great learning the universities of
Ireland shall show them as I guess.&#8217; The Government only
was weak. There were but fifty hundredweight of lead in
store, and Fitzwilliam thought he might have to strip the
material for bullets from some house or church.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Kildare, whose foreign education and connection made
him more dangerous than any of his ancestors had been, was
undoubtedly playing with edged tools. Desmond refused to
pay cess. The two earls had met at Limerick, and would
certainly join Donnell O&#8217;Brien if he landed with the expected
foreign aid. There were rumours of French ships on the
coast, and frequent messengers passed between Kildare, Desmond,
and Shane O&#8217;Neill. Edmond Boy, a Geraldine who
was usually employed on this dangerous service, warned a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
relation who had married an Englishman to sell all and fly
the realm, for if all promises were kept, her husband would
never reap that he had sown. Kildare not only kept his
followers under arms, but declared that he and his friends
would be slaves no longer, presided at assemblies of Irishmen,
and ostentatiously heard mass in public. Of all this there
was ample evidence, and in addition, Lady Tyrone had sought
interviews with the Lord Justice, and sworn the interpreter
to secrecy. Laying the Bible first on her own head and then
on his, &#8216;which is the surest kind of oath taken with them,&#8217;
she made a very positive statement as to the alliance of her
son Shane and the two Geraldine earls. The Countess indeed,
Fitzwilliam told Cecil, was &#8216;something busy-headed and largely-tongued,
crafty and very malicious, no great heed to be given
to her, unless some other thing might lend credit to the
tale she telleth, as in this there is.&#8217; There was quite enough
to cause anxiety, and the Government were almost defenceless.
&#8216;Send us over men,&#8217; the Lord Justice cried, &#8216;that we may fight

<div class="sidenote">Attitude
of Spain,
France, and
Scotland.</div>

<p>It was still the policy of Philip II. to appear as Elizabeth&#8217;s
protector, anxious to save her from the consequences of her
own rashness and to give her time to repent. This half contemptuous
patronage was the result of mere statecraft, and
the Queen gave no credit for kindliness to a man who had no
such element in his nature. The first sighs of the great storm
had been heard in the Netherlands. With France and Scotland
united, and with England crushed as Philip thought she
might be, the power of Spain in Northern Europe would be
endangered. The Catholic King would therefore give no help
to Catholic Ireland. The Christian King could give none;
nor even maintain his ground in Scotland. The French fleet
had been cast away, and the Huguenots were at no pains to
hide their sympathy with English and Scotch reformers. The
conspiracy of Amboise showed what might be expected.
Francis II. was nought, and the hatred of Catherine de&#8217; Medici
for her lovely daughter-in-law paralysed the efforts of the states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>men
who ruled about him. Brave and full of resource, but without
help or hope, D&#8217;Oysel was shut up in Leith, the national
skill of his followers making the best of rats and horseflesh
while Winter&#8217;s ships lay off Inchkeith, the unchallenged tyrants
of the sea. Mary of Lorraine died with a Calvinist preacher
by her bedside, and the power of Rome was for ever broken in
Scotland. Under such circumstances no outbreak in Ireland
could have a chance of success, and the plottings of the Geraldines
with O&#8217;Briens and O&#8217;Neills came for the time to nothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sussex
made Lord-Lieutenant,
1560.</div>

<p>Fortified by constant intercourse with the Queen and
Cecil, Sussex returned to Ireland with the title of Lord-Lieutenant,
which had not been conferred since the death of
Henry VIII.&#8217;s son, and which was not to be conferred again
till it was given to the rash favourite whose fate darkened
Elizabeth&#8217;s last days. He told the Queen that he was willing
to surrender his post to anyone who would go against Shane
O&#8217;Neill on easier terms. &#8216;She seeth,&#8217; he said, &#8216;that I affect
not that governance.&#8217; He had repudiated with scorn the
accusation that he had put to death those who surrendered
under protection. &#8216;If the cause,&#8217; he said, &#8216;were mine own
I would ask trial like a gentleman, but it is the Queen&#8217;s.
My word is not the Earl of Sussex&#8217;s word but Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s
word, my lie her lie.&#8217; Noble words: but too imperfectly remembered
in the hour of trial.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Private and

to Sussex.</div>

<p>Sussex&#8217;s written instructions show no apprehension of
foreign enemies, except that he was authorised to contribute
a sum not exceeding 250<i>l.</i> to the fortification of Waterford.
If Sorley Boy MacDonnell&#8217;s profession of loyalty were fulfilled,
he might receive a grant of the lands he claimed. But Shane
O&#8217;Neill was to be curbed either by fair means or force. There
was no longer a disposition on the Queen&#8217;s part to accept him
as an established fact, and the young Baron of Dungannon
was if possible to be maintained against him. Noblemen and
gentlemen were to be encouraged to surrender their estates
and to receive them back by fresh grants, while Sussex was
urged to proceed with the settlement of Leix and Offaly, which
was visible only on paper. The garrisons were in fact the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
only fixed inhabitants. The remaining instructions were such
as were generally given to Irish governors, and were chiefly
concerned with improvements in the revenue and with the
satisfaction of private or official suits.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
sees the
difficulty
of Irish government.</div>

<p>But in private conversation with her representative Elizabeth
held language of which her indefatigable secretary did
not fail to make a minute, and which showed how deeply impressed
she was with the magnitude of the Irish difficulty.
The chief danger was evidently from Kildare&#8217;s dealings with
the foreigners, and Sussex was to persuade him if possible to
go to England. It was the habit of Irish lords on such
occasions to plead the want of ready cash, and the Earl was
to be authorised to draw to any reasonable amount on London
on giving his bond for repayment in Dublin. Kildare would
have been a gainer, and the Queen a loser by the exchange.
If he would not cross the Channel by this golden bridge Sussex
was authorised to use a letter written by the Queen herself
to Kildare, in which she commanded his attendance at Court.
A date was to be affixed which might make it appear that the
royal missive had followed and not accompanied the Lord-Lieutenant
to Ireland. If this failed, Kildare and his most
prominent friends, including Desmond, were to be arrested at
the earliest opportunity. &#8216;And for satisfaction of the subjects
of the land the Lord-Lieutenant shall cause to be published
by proclamation or otherwise the reasonable causes of his
doings, leading only to the quiet of the realm.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts
to reconcile
Desmond
and
Ormonde.</div>

<p>The death of the Regent and the expulsion of the French
from Scotland put an end for the time to any apprehensions
from France. If Desmond and Ormonde were once at peace
the Lord-Lieutenant would have leisure to settle Shane O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s
account. The manors of Clonmel, Kilsheelan, and Kilfeacle
had long been in dispute between the two earls, and a thousand
acts of violence were the result. The lawsuit was now about
to be decided in a pitched battle. Men came from the Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and the Shannon on one side and from Wexford on the other,
and met near Tipperary, but separated without fighting,
probably owing to the efforts of Lady Desmond. Sir George
Stanley, Marshal of the Army, the veteran negotiator Cusack,
and Parker the Master of the Rolls, were sent to Clonmel to
decide the most pressing matters in dispute, which consisted
chiefly of spoils committed by the tenants and partisans of
the two earls on each other. The White Knight especially,
whose lands bordered on Tipperary, was constantly at war
with his Butler neighbours. An award was given, on the
whole favourable to Desmond; but the peace thus obtained
was not destined to endure.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane
O&#8217;Neill

own.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Shane O&#8217;Neill, in spite of his &#8216;misused&#8217; MacDonnell
wife, sought Argyle&#8217;s sister in marriage; but that
chief was engaged in the English and Protestant interest,
and sent the letter of proposal to Elizabeth. So far from
allying himself with the O&#8217;Neills, Argyle offered to provide
3,000 Highlanders for immediate service in Ireland, if the
Queen would pay them, and 1,000 for permanent garrison
duty on the same terms. James MacDonnell was willing to
serve in person. These were no empty promises, for Argyle
and MacDonnell had the men ready in the following spring;
and the Queen thought she saw her way to &#8216;afflict Shane with
condign punishment to the terror of all his sept.&#8217; Gilbert
Gerrard, Attorney-General of England, who had been sent
over to report on the revenues, told Cecil that Ireland would
be difficult to govern, and that many people cared for nothing
but the sword. O&#8217;Donnell, O&#8217;Reilly, and Maguire might be
induced to act loyally in hopes of throwing off O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s
tyranny, and the MacDonnells from the fear of losing their
estates. All pointed to the necessity of vigorous action; but
the summer passed and nothing was done.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reports
as to the
Queen&#8217;s
marriage.</div>

<p>These were the days when everyone expected Elizabeth
to marry. Cecil went to Scotland, where the general wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
was that the half-witted Arran should unite the two kingdoms.
On his return he found that his policy had been thwarted
by &#8216;back counsels;&#8217; and he talked of resigning his place.
Sussex wrote in horror at the prospect, for he thought the
Queen would be but slenderly provided with counsel elsewhere,
and under certain circumstances, such perhaps as a Dudley
ministry, he himself would not serve ten months in Ireland&mdash;no,
not for 10,000<i>l.</i> The dark tragedy on the staircase at
Cumnor left Dudley free, and for a moment most men supposed
that the Queen&#8217;s partiality would end in marriage. Sussex
did not take so unfavourable a view of the match as the
secretary. According to his view the great national requirement
was an heir to the Crown, and there would be a better
chance of one if Elizabeth married the object of her affections.
Sussex declared himself ready to serve, honour, and obey any
one to whom it might please God to direct the Queen&#8217;s choice.
Had this advice been given to Elizabeth the writer might be
suspected of flattery, and of seeking friends of the mammon
of unrighteousness; but, spoken to such unwilling ears as
Cecil&#8217;s, it must be considered highly honourable.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reform
of the
coinage.</div>

<p>In Ireland as in England, Elizabeth gained great and
deserved credit by reforming the coinage. From the time of
John till that of Edward IV. there had been no difference
between the two standards; but in the latter reign that of
Ireland suffered a depreciation of twenty-five per cent. An
Irish shilling was henceforth worth no more than ninepence
in England. There must have been a loss to the public and
a gain to the Exchequer at first, but bullion finds its own
level like water, and there were no further fluctuations. Having
become a settled and understood thing, the difference caused
little trouble. But when Henry VIII. began to tamper with
the currency great loss and inconvenience followed. The
quantity of silver&mdash;the common drudge &#8217;twixt man and man&mdash;in
any given piece of money could scarcely be guessed at by
the ordinary citizen. Barrels full of counterfeit coin were
imported, and added much to the confusion. Tradesmen
raised prices to save themselves. All good coin was exported to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
buy foreign wares, and the course was continually downwards,
as it must inevitably be under similar circumstances. Inconvertible
notes proved highly inconvenient in America and
in Italy; but they were nothing to the metallic counters of
the Tudors, which depended less upon credit than upon uncertain
intrinsic values. Communications were difficult, there
were no newspapers, and money dealers flourished. At every
exchange a burden was imposed on industry. Those who
have been in Turkish towns, and have seen a sovereign waste
as it passes from one currency to another, can form an idea of
what Dublin and Drogheda suffered through the ignorance
and dishonesty of the English Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chaotic
state of the
currency.</div>

<p>What Henry began Edward and Mary continued, and
Ireland was deluged with innumerable varieties of bad
money. Some of Mary&#8217;s shillings were worth little more than
the copper they contained. She also by proclamation authorised
the adulterated rose-pence of her father and brother to be
used in Ireland, though they were prohibited in England. In
a paper drawn up for Elizabeth&#8217;s Council, five kinds of small
coins are enumerated, of every degree of baseness, and of
values between 5-1/3<i>d.</i> and 1-1/3<i>d.</i> English. One of these, the old
Irish groat, was worth threepence, but had several varieties.
Thus <i>Dominus</i> groats were those struck before Henry VIII.
assumed the royal title, <i>Rex</i> groats were those struck after;
none were of a good standard. The quantity of coin no
more than three ounces fine was estimated at from 60,000 to
100,000 lbs. To cleanse the Augean stables it was proposed
to restore the Irish mint, which had been abandoned for want
of silver at the end of Edward VI.&#8217;s reign. The repair of the
furnaces was begun, wood was cut, and the mixed money was
cried down for a recoinage. But the inducements offered
proved insufficient, and the merchants hoarded the Irish money
instead of bringing it in. The plan was then changed. A
reward was offered for bringing in the bad coin, and fresh
money was struck in England on the basis of the practice
which prevailed from Edward IV. to Henry VIII. Ninepence
sterling was fixed as the value of an Irish shilling; some of
the old money, particularly that of the lower denominations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
seems to have been put in circulation, but it was used merely
as counters and was not complained of. The currency question
slumbered until 1602, when Elizabeth fell away somewhat
from her early virtue, and partially revived the grievance
which she had redressed.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>Kildare had the wit to see that times were changed, and
that the Crown would be too strong for any possible combination;
but others were less well informed, or more sanguine.
Some of the O&#8217;Mores held a meeting at Holy Cross in
Tipperary, where Neill M&#8217;Lice was chosen chief of Leix.
The object of this unfortunate clan was of course the retention
of their lands, to which they clung with desperate
resolution. Shane sent a rymer, one of those <i>improvisatori</i>
who were always at hand to carry dangerous messages, bidding
them to trust no man&#8217;s word, but to wait for orders from him.
Desmond was also consulted. According to one account he
offered the conspirators a refuge in the last resort; according
to another, he had promised to send actual assistance. The
matter came to Ormonde&#8217;s ears, and he appeared suddenly at
Holy Cross, dispersed the meeting, and took three of the principal
men prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzwilliam

O&#8217;Neill

<p>Elizabeth saw that nothing of importance could be done
without an effort, and being in one of her frugal moods, she
was disinclined to make that effort. She summoned Sussex
over for a personal conference, reminding him that she had
formerly been charged with other items besides his salary,
and suggesting that part of it should now be devoted to the
payment of a Lord Justice, &#8216;which, considering our other
charges, we think you cannot mislike.&#8217; As soon as Fitzwilliam&#8217;s
commission arrived, Sussex left Ireland; but Shane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
O&#8217;Neill did not wish to let the Lord-Lieutenant have the
sole telling of the story. Shane was in communication with
Philip, who bade him not be discouraged, for that he should
not want help. Letters to this effect were brought by the
parish priests of Howth and Dundalk, and O&#8217;Neill then wrote
to the Queen in a very haughty strain. He asked leave to
correspond freely with the Secretary, and solicited the admission
of his messenger to the Queen&#8217;s presence. &#8216;There is
nothing,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I inwardly desire of God so much&#8217; as that
&#8216;the Queen should know what a faithful subject I mean to
be to her Grace.&#8217; For her Majesty&#8217;s information, he stated
forcibly his case against the Dungannon branch, invariably
calling his rival Matthew Kelly, and laying great stress on
his own election by the tribe. &#8216;According,&#8217; he wrote, &#8216;to the
ancient custom of this county of Tyrone time out of mind, all
the lords and gentlemen of Ulster assembled themselves, and
as well for that I was known to be the right heir unto my
said father, as also thought most worthiest to supply my
father&#8217;s room, according to the said custom, by one assent
and one voice they did elect and choose me to be O&#8217;Neill, and
by that name did call me, and next under your Majesty took
me to be their lord and governor, and no other else would
they have had.&#8217; The effect had been magical. All the North
for eighty miles had been waste, without people, cattle, or
houses, &#8216;save a little that the spirituality of Armagh had,&#8217;
and now there was not one town uninhabited. If the Queen
would give Ireland into his keeping, she would soon have a
revenue where she had now only expense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane will

Matthew up and down, he would long since have expelled
the Scots, who had been reinforced by Lady Tyrone, and supported
by Sussex. The Lord-Lieutenant had given them

Englishman,&#8217; having held his estate since the first conquest.
The Queen was thus answerable for the strength of the Scots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and without her help he could not undertake to drive them
out. Kelly had been killed in a skirmish by chance of war,
and he was not to be held answerable for so usual an accident.
In fact, he was a blameless subject, who had committed no
fault knowingly; &#8216;but through being wild and savage, not
knowing the extremity of her Majesty&#8217;s laws, nor yet brought
up in any civility whereby he might avoid the same, having
also many wild and unruly persons, and hard to be corrected
in his country.&#8217; By a stretch of legal ingenuity their misdeeds
might possibly be laid at his door, and to avoid that,
and &#8216;not for any mistrust of his own behaviour,&#8217; he asked for
protection. Unable to trust Sussex, he had sent over the
respectable Dean of Armagh to bring a safe-conduct from the
Queen herself, which would enable him to lay his case in
person before the English Council, and to return safely. For
his expenses he should require 8,000<i>l.</i> sterling, which, with
a fine irony, he declared himself quite willing to repay in
Irish currency. For fear of mischances, the Earl of Kildare
and other men of rank should be directed to put him safely
on board, and to deliver him at Holyhead into Sir Henry
Sidney&#8217;s charge. After his return Sussex should not be
allowed to molest him for three months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane&#8217;s
grievances
against
Sussex.</div>

<p>Besides the main grievance about Matthew Kelly, Shane
had fault to find with governors in general, and Sussex in
particular. When a very young man he had discovered a
plot to attack the Pale, and having respect to the common
weal of his native country, he had gone boldly to Sir Anthony
St. Leger without any safe-conduct. St. Leger had been so
much impressed with his virtue that he and all his Council
had signed a contract, &#8216;which I have to be showed,&#8217; to give
him 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> sterling a day. Since that he had suffered much,
but not a groat of the pension had ever been paid. Still he
bore no malice, and had offered his services to Sussex against
the Scots. The Lord-Lieutenant was nevertheless firmly
prejudiced in favour of Matthew Kelly, and determined that
he, the legitimate chief, should be no officer of his. He
accused Sussex of putting innocent men to death, and thus
making it impossible for any one to trust him. Sussex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
always indignantly denied this charge, and he was borne out
by Kildare and by the Irish Council.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He compares
Tyrone
favourably
with the
Pale.</div>

<p>Shane proudly contrasted the state of his country with
that of the Pale, and suggested that the Queen should send
over two incorruptible men joined in commission with the
mayor and aldermen of Dublin and Drogheda, &#8216;which are
worshipful and faithful subjects,&#8217; to judge which country was
the better governed. They might hear the charges against
him, and also the complaints of the families of the Pale, &#8216;what
intolerable burdens they endure of cess, taxes, and tallages both
of corn, beefs, muttons, porks, and baks.&#8217; Not only did the
soldiers live at free quarters, but they had &#8216;their dogs and
their concubines all the whole year along in the poor farmers&#8217;
houses, paying in effect nothing for all the same.&#8217; Not less
than 300 farmers had gone into Shane&#8217;s county out of the
Pale. These men were once rich, and had good houses, but
they dared not so much as tell their griefs to the Queen, &#8216;yet
the birds of the air will at length declare it unto you.&#8217; Shane
considered it &#8216;a very evil sign that men shall forsake the Pale,
and come and dwell among wild savage people.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane&#8217;s legitimacy.</div>

<p>Besides his pretensions to the Earldom, or to the captaincy
of Tyrone, Matthew Kelly also advanced a claim to the manor
of Balgriffin, in the county of Dublin, which had been granted
to Con O&#8217;Neill, with remainder to his son, Matthew O&#8217;Neill,
and in default of him and his heirs, with remainder to the
right heirs of Con. Shane had taken legal opinions, and was
advised that he had a title to Balgriffin, because there was no
Matthew O&#8217;Neill at the time of the grant. &#8216;It follows plainly,&#8217;
he argued, &#8216;that I am my father&#8217;s right heir, legitimate begotten,
and although my said father accepted him as his son,
by no law that ever was since the beginning, he could not
take him from his own father and mother which were then in
plain life.&#8217; Besides which he had inherited the land of &#8216;his
own natural father the smith.&#8217; If the premise that Matthew
was Kelly and not an O&#8217;Neill be admitted, the reasoning is
irrefragable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He desires
an English
wife.</div>

<p>Badly as he had been treated, Shane declared himself ready
to make restitution wherever anything could be proved against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
him. His savagery, which he confessed again and again, he
thought could best be eradicated by an English wife, &#8216;some
gentlewoman of some noble blood meet for my vocation,
whereby I might have a friendship towards your Majesty.&#8217;
This impossible she would indeed be much more than an
intermediary between him and the Queen to declare his grief
and those of his country. &#8216;By her good civility and bringing
up, the country,&#8217; he hoped, &#8216;would become civil, and my generation
so mixed, I and my posterity should ever after know
their duties.&#8217; Some educated companion was necessary to
him; for the men of the Pale would not even show him how
to address his letters properly, and he feared to offend,
whereas he desired nothing so much as her Majesty&#8217;s approbation
and favour. How Shane treated an accomplished
woman when he had her in his power will appear hereafter.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane
threatens
the Pale.</div>

<p>To enforce his demands, and to show how disagreeable he
could be, Shane burned three villages on the borders of the
Pale. Their crime was giving asylum to Henry, son of Phelim
Roe O&#8217;Neill, who had offended by his loyalty. With much
difficulty and many smooth words, the invader was prevented
from spreading his ravages further; but he went so far as to
threaten the town of Dundalk for sheltering his disobedient
namesake, and he demanded an authority equal to that which
Desmond had over the western seaports.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">He proposes
to go to
England.</div>

<p>Shane&#8217;s proposal to go to Court was accepted in order to
gain time. A safe-conduct was sent, and Fitzwilliam was
instructed to make his departure easy. Either really suspicious,
or anxious to make it appear that he was ill-treated,
the troublesome chief then began to make excuses, the most
valid being that he had no money. Fitzwilliam wrote him a
soothing letter, and Shane then said his retinue could not be
ready for nearly two months. He held out stoutly for 3,000<i>l.</i>
at least, but it was feared that he would rebel on receipt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
it, &#8216;conduct,&#8217; said the Lord Justice, &#8216;which to his kind best
belongeth.&#8217; In the meantime he amused himself by plundering
the O&#8217;Reillys and those on the borders of the Pale.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Intrigues
with
Scotland.</div>

<p>While Fitzwilliam was temporising with Shane in Ireland,
Sussex was intriguing against him in Scotland. His messenger
carried credentials to the Ambassador Randolph, to
Argyle, and to James MacDonnell. He was directed to visit
them all, and if possible to see O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s wife, a sister of
Argyle, who continually hovered between Ireland and Scotland.
He was then to cross the Channel, find his way to
O&#8217;Donnell, and offer him the Earldom of Tyrconnel in the
Queen&#8217;s name. To Argyle Cecil wrote as to a friend whom
he had learned to value when in Scotland, urging him to &#8216;use
stoutness and constancy, or the adversary will double his
courage, where contrariwise the Papist being indeed full of
cowardness ... will yield.&#8217; Large offers were made to
James MacDonnell and his brother Sorley Boy, and it was
hoped that all the most powerful men in the North might
thus be united against the redoubtable Shane.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
prepares
for war, but
endeavours
to conciliate
the
Irish
nobility.</div>

<p>Sir Henry Radclyffe, the Lord-Lieutenant&#8217;s brother,
thought Shane had money enough if he would be contented
with reasonable expenses, but that he had sought counsel of
those who were against the journey, and was chiefly anxious
to gain time. He daily muddled his &#8216;unstable head&#8217; with
wine, and every boon companion could affect his judgment.
That drunken brain was nevertheless clear enough to baffle
Elizabeth for a long time. Perhaps Shane really expected help
from Philip. Radclyffe thought him hopeless, and quoted
Ovid as to the desirability of cutting out incurable sores
before they had time to poison the blood. These opinions
prevailed, and warlike preparations were swiftly and silently
made. Six hundred additional men were sent to Ireland, and
a general hosting was ordered. O&#8217;Reilly was encouraged to
hope for the Earldom of Brefny, and robes and coronets for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
him and for O&#8217;Donnell were actually sent. O&#8217;Madden and
O&#8217;Shaughnessy in Connaught, were thanked for former services,
and exhorted to deserve thanks in the future. Shane, wrote
the Queen, was the common disturber. He had offered to go
to Court and then drew back, though she had with her own
hands given the required safe-conduct to his messenger.
Conciliation had been tried in vain; and she was now obliged
to resort to force. They were directed in all things to be
guided by Sussex, whom her Majesty quite exonerated from
Shane&#8217;s slanders.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzwilliam
and
Kildare.</div>

<p>While his official superior was at Court, Fitzwilliam
had no easy time in Dublin. He disliked and distrusted
Kildare, who declined all responsibility for his bastard kinsfolk,
the old scourges of the marches living at free quarters
and disdaining honest industry. The MacCoghlans surprised
one of the Earl&#8217;s innumerable castles, in which they were
assisted by Ferdinando O&#8217;Daly, an Irishman in Fitzwilliam&#8217;s
service. Kildare made a prisoner of O&#8217;Daly, and the Lord
Justice thought his position as the Queen&#8217;s representative
required his liberation. They were &#8216;tickle times, and many
evil and rude men depend upon his Lordship, who with one
wink might stir mischief.&#8217; The Lord Justice offered to make
good any harm that O&#8217;Daly might have done, but insisted on
his enlargement, because it did not stand with the credit of
his office that any servant of his should lie in gyves. Kildare
at first refused to give the man up, and on the Lord Justice
persisting, said he was in the custody of his captor, who had
been promised a ransom of forty marks. O&#8217;Daly was ultimately
released, and probably Fitzwilliam paid the forty marks.
In the meantime Shane had been acting while his opponents
talked.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Shane
seizes
O&#8217;Donnell
and his
wife.</div>

<p>The O&#8217;Donnells, under a son of the chief, besieged an
island in Lough Veagh, occupied by one of those pretenders
who were never wanting in any Irish country. The chief
himself lay at a Franciscan friary, eleven miles from his son,
and with only &#8216;a few soldiers, besides women and poets.&#8217;
Among the women was his wife, by birth a Maclean, widow
of an Earl of Argyle, noted for her wisdom and sobriety, a
good French scholar with a knowledge of Latin, and a
smattering of Italian, but at heart a rake who had been
dazzled by Shane&#8217;s successful career. She contrived to let
the object of her admiration know her husband&#8217;s defenceless
condition, and he was only too ready to take the hint. A
meeting of the two chiefs was arranged for May 15. O&#8217;Neill
was not far off, and on the night of the 14th he appeared
in force at the monastery gates. Had they been shut defence
might have been possible, for O&#8217;Donnell had 1,500 Scots
mercenaries within five miles; but they had been left open,
probably on purpose, and O&#8217;Donnell and his wife were carried
off into Tyrone. The night attack of four years before was
thus amply avenged. Calvagh was kept in close and cruel
confinement, and as Shane&#8217;s mistress the wise countess soon
had reason to deplore her folly and perfidy.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane is
supreme in
Ulster.</div>

<p>A messenger whom O&#8217;Neill had sent to Fitzwilliam used
very insolent language, such as he had no doubt been accustomed
to hear from his chief&#8217;s mouth. The Lord Justice
complained, and Shane, whose cue was not to offend the Queen
or her representative, said that his envoy was a scamp who
had exceeded his instructions, and that he had tortured him
and slit his ear. But the Government thought Shane incorrigible,
and in this at least they were supported by Kildare.
O&#8217;Neill was proclaimed a rebel and traitor. Either on this or
some later occasion an Irish jester remarked that, except
traitor was a more honourable title than O&#8217;Neill, he would
never consent to Shane&#8217;s assumption of it, a joke which gained
point from the feebleness of the proceedings against him. In
the eyes of the Lord Justice he was the bully of the North;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
in the eyes of the Irish he was King of Ulster from Drogheda
to the Erne, with power very little diminished by the opposition
of the English.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Sussex landed on June 2, and advanced within three weeks

garrison of 200 men. Shane could do nothing in
the field, but withdrew with his cattle to the border of Tyrconnel.
Calvagh O&#8217;Donnell was hurried about from one

messenger a superlatively gracious answer. In the meantime
he demanded withdrawal of the garrison, maintaining that
the war was unjust and unprovoked. He had not, he said,
libelled the Lord-Lieutenant, and had he done so he would
have scorned to deny his authorship. He professed great
readiness to go to London, but repeated that money was necessary,
and laid upon the Viceroy the whole responsibility of
nullifying the Queen&#8217;s good intentions. In future, he grandly
declared, he would communicate only with head-quarters, and
he hoped that her Majesty would support his efforts to civilise
his wild country. He was not such a fool as to put himself in
the power of an Irish Government, and he gave a long list of
Irishmen who had suffered torture or death through their
reliance on official promises. Sussex replied that the money
was ready for Shane if he would come for it before the campaign
began, and he issued a proclamation calling on the
O&#8217;Neills to support the young heir to the Earldom of Tyrone.
Shane merely warned the Baron of Slane to look out for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
something unpleasant; for Earl of Ulster he intended to
be. That great dignity had long been merged in the Crown,
and the Baron could hardly fail to see what Shane was
aiming at.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane surprises
the
Viceregal
army.</div>

<p>When all was ready the army encamped near Armagh,
which it was proposed to make a store-house for plunder.
Five hundred cows and many horses were taken in a raid
northwards; but the Blackwater was flooded, and nothing
more could be done for several days. Not to be quite idle,
Sussex sent Ormonde to Shane, who offered worthless hostages
for his prompt departure to England, but refused to give up
O&#8217;Donnell. An attempt was then made against some cattle
which were discovered on the borders of Macmahon&#8217;s country.
In compliance with a recognised Irish custom, Macmahon was
probably obliged to support a certain number of his powerful
neighbour&#8217;s stock. Sir George Stanley, with Fitzwilliam and
Wingfield, went on this service with 200 horse, seven companies
and a half of English foot, 200 gallowglasses, 100
Scots, and all the kerne in camp. Ormonde was ill, and
Sussex in an evil hour, as he himself says, stayed to keep him
company. The cattle were driven off, and no enemy appeared.
On their return Shane overtook the troops with twelve horse,
300 Scots, and 200 gallowglasses. Wingfield, who commanded
the rear guard of infantry, allowed himself to be
surprised, and for a time all was confusion. The column was
long, and some time passed before Stanley and Fitzwilliam
knew what had happened. They at once attacked the Irish
in flank, and Shane in turn suffered some loss; indeed, the
annalists say, with a fine rhetorical vagueness, that countless
numbers were slain on both sides. But the cattle, the original
cause of the expedition, were not brought into Armagh. The
moral effect of the check was disastrous, and Sussex, though
he put the best face on the matter when writing to Elizabeth,
exaggerating Shane&#8217;s losses and making light of his own, did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
not conceal the truth from Cecil. &#8216;By the cowardice of some,&#8217;
he wrote, &#8216;all were like to have been lost, and by the worthiness
of two men all was restored.&#8217; Wingfield was chiefly
blamed, but the Lord-Lieutenant bitterly reproached himself
for remaining behind when so large a force was in the field.
Fifty of his best men were killed and fifty wounded, and it
was impossible to take that prompt revenge which alone can
restore the reputation of an army when defeated in a hostile
country by a barbarian enemy. &#8216;This last July,&#8217; said the
unhappy Viceroy, &#8216;having spent our victuals at Armagh, we
do return to the Newry to conduct a new mass of victuals to
Armagh.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Anger of
the Queen.</div>

<p>When Cecil heard the evil tidings he says himself that
he was so appalled that he had much ado to hide his grief, the
rather that Lord Pembroke being away there was no one
with whom he could share it. To the Queen he spoke as
lightly as he could of a little bickering in which Shane had
the greater loss, which to the letter was true. For the benefit
of the general public Cecil gave out that Shane had been
overthrown with the loss of two or three captains. Privately
he urged Sussex to use strong measures with those who had
shown cowardice. But it was seldom possible to hide the
truth from Elizabeth, and she soon knew all. She gave orders
that Wingfield should be deprived of all his offices, and dismissed
her service with ignominy. But the wrath of Sussex
soon cooled, or perhaps his conscience made him generous.
It was discovered that Wingfield&#8217;s patent as Master of the
Ordnance could not be voided, because he had acted only as
a simple captain. His services among the O&#8217;Byrnes were
remembered, and both Sussex and Ormonde interceded for
him. At his own urgent request he was summoned to Court,
when he probably succeeded in rebutting the charge of actual
cowardice, and he remained Master of the Ordnance till his
death in 1587.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

again proposes
to go
to the
Queen.</div>

<p>Having driven the English out of his country, Shane
O&#8217;Neill proposed to treat with Ormonde, no doubt with the
deliberate intention of insulting Sussex. To Ormonde accordingly
he sent his messenger, Neal Gray, with power to
make terms. Shane was ready to go to the Queen, and to
repair the church at Armagh. But he would not make peace
while the soldiers remained there, and he declared that no
one in his senses would believe in the peace while such a sign
of war remained. To show his own idea of peace and friendship
he asked Sussex to be his gossip, and to give him his
sister&#8217;s hand. The Lord-Lieutenant declined to withdraw the
garrison until the Queen&#8217;s pleasure should be known. Fitzwilliam
had gone to her, and Ormonde, knowing that nothing
would be done till his return, had gone home. If Shane hurt
any of his neighbours in the meantime, he was warned that
he could never hope to see the Queen&#8217;s face. Sussex marvelled
at the constant changes in Shane&#8217;s answers. &#8216;O&#8217;Neill desired
me to procure the Queen&#8217;s pardon and protection, for the which
at his request we have already sent Mr. Treasurer, and now
he desireth to send his own messengers, whereby it seemeth
he should seek delays, for that his messengers cannot go and
return with such speed as Mr. Treasurer will do. And we
know not to what other purpose he should send his messenger
thither. Therefore we will him to send us word by writing
directly whether he will go to the Queen&#8217;s Majesty, according
his oath taken, if Mr. Treasurer bring him the Queen&#8217;s
pardon and protection.&#8217; To this Shane haughtily answered
that he would make no peace with any of his vassals (urraghs)
but at his own time and in his own way, and that he would
receive neither pardon nor protection from the Queen unless
they were delivered to his own messenger. In his natural
anger at such an answer, Sussex called loudly for strong
measures: &#8216;if Shane be overthrown, all is settled; if Shane
settle, all is overthrown.&#8217; It was no fault of his that the arch-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>rebel
would not go to the Queen. Indeed, it was well known
that Kildare had first advised that step to gain time, and then
prevented its being taken for the same reason.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewed
preparations.</div>

<p>Fitzwilliam was instructed to ask for an immediate aid of
200 men, and 3,000<i>l.</i> The men were ordered from Berwick,
and 2,000<i>l.</i> of the money was sent. Transports were pressed
upon the Lancashire coast, and the Queen wrote in her best
style to encourage Sussex. His ill success, she was sure, had
come from no want of goodwill, and the chances of war were
to be borne patiently; but she marvelled that the General
had not punished those who showed cowardice. Traitors and
cowards were to be sent to gaol without favour or affection.
The Queen impressed the value of patience upon Sussex, her
own principle being rather to recover the subject by persuasion
than force. She was willing to give Ormonde a
reasonable sum for Shane&#8217;s expenses, leaving the question of
security to Sussex. She would not withdraw the garrison,
but would undertake that it should molest no one except
notorious traitors proclaimed before last March. In the meantime
Sussex was to prepare for war by discharging unserviceable
men, and by withholding the pay of runaways. The
Lord-Lieutenant was required to forget his private dislike to
Kildare, and to work with him loyally for the good of the
service.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sussex
proposes to
have Shane
O&#8217;Neill
killed.</div>

<p>Stung by failure, and fearing to be outwitted after all,
Sussex now devised a safer and surer method than either war
or diplomacy. There had perhaps already been one attempt
to stab O&#8217;Neill, which he attributed to Sussex; but we are
not bound to believe this, for a chief who punished unsuccessful
agents by torturing them and slitting their ears was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
likely to gain much affection. Neill Gray now declared that
he was ready to serve the Queen, if Sussex would write to her
on his behalf. The nature of the service required was not
such as could be publicly avowed, and Gray swore on the
Bible to keep it secret, on pain of death, if it became known
during the continuance of the Earl&#8217;s government. &#8216;For the
benefit of his country and his own assurance,&#8217; he agreed to
do whatever Sussex wished, and &#8216;in fine I brake with him to
kill Shane, and bound myself by my oath to see him have
100 marks of land by the year to him and his heirs for his
reward. He seemed desirous to serve your Highness, and to
have the land, but fearful to do it, doubting his own escape
after. I told him the way how he might do it, and how
to escape after with safety;&#8217; and at last Gray promised to
do it if he saw a prospect of security. Sussex assured the
Queen that his accomplice might do it without danger if he
chose, &#8216;and if he will not do what he may in your service,
there will be done to him what others may. God send your
Highness a good end.&#8217; To hire a man to murder your enemy,
and to determine to murder that hireling in the event of failure,
are hardly matters deserving of divine favour, and it is deeply
to be regretted that no letter is extant from Elizabeth expressing
horror at the scheme. Such a letter may nevertheless
have been written, for it would have been the interest of
Sussex to destroy all evidence of the contemplated crime. On
the same day that the Lord-Lieutenant attempted to make
his sovereign an accessory before the fact, he informed her of
the way in which he had received Shane&#8217;s matrimonial proposal.
&#8216;I told him he should at his coming find my sister at
the Court, and if I liked the other, I would further it as much
as I could.&#8217; The treachery of Judas was hardly more dramatically
complete. It must not, however, be forgotten that
Shane was a proclaimed traitor, and that the political morality
of the day was very different from ours. Sussex may have
thought he was doing little more than putting a price upon
an outlaw&#8217;s head.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">General
disaffection.</div>

<p>Nothing came of the plot; but Neill Gray was too deeply
implicated to venture on a double treason, and the Lord-Lieutenant&#8217;s
secret was kept. But &#8216;slanderous bruits&#8217; against
him were rife on other accounts; for the feeling on the border
was in Shane&#8217;s favour, and there was a general hesitation
about putting him down effectually. It was said that Sussex
would be superseded, and the date of his intended departure
was named positively. The hundred tongues of rumour were
busy in giving the sword to one man to-day and to another
to-morrow. Everything was believed but the truth, and as
a natural consequence orders were badly obeyed. Sussex
urged strongly that the campaign must be prosecuted, or that
everything must be left to Shane, who claimed jurisdiction
over all inhabitants of the northern province, including those
who held direct of the Queen, and had never been subject to
any O&#8217;Neill. &#8216;So as we see, Ulster is the scope he challengeth,&#8217;
and if he once gained that there was no reason why he should
not shoot even higher. Amid the general disaffection Sussex
was afraid to carry out the Queen&#8217;s orders about punishing
Wingfield and the other delinquents in the affair of July,
when, as common report affirmed, the army was overthrown
with small loss to Shane.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sussex
again takes
the field.</div>

<p>With a heavy heart the Lord-Lieutenant led an unusually
large force to Armagh. The magnitude of the effort may be
estimated from the fact that four out of the five earls then in
Ireland took part in the expedition, Thomond and Clanricarde
being left to defend the principal camp, eight miles north of
Dundalk. From Armagh Sussex made a rapid march across
Slieve Gullion to the head of Glenconkein, a wild forest tract
near the southern boundary of what is now the county of
Londonderry. No resistance was offered, and 4,000 head of
cattle, with many ponies and stud mares, were driven back,
&#8216;so that they might see them who would otherwise have been
hard of belief.&#8217; Knowing by experience how hard it was to
progress when thus encumbered, the Lord-Lieutenant ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
all the beasts to be slaughtered, except a few which were
kept for provisions. All the country between Armagh and
the mountains was destroyed, and the army then proceeded
to Omagh, and thence to Lough Foyle, where Con O&#8217;Donnell
and others were expected to appear, and where a victualling
fleet was supposed to be in waiting. But the ill fortune which
attended Sussex in Ireland did not desert him here. The
ships, which had been forty days at sea, were not to be seen,
and the Earl, having had the poor satisfaction of seeing Lough
Foyle, returned to Newry with 500 cows which he picked up
on the march. &#8216;Man,&#8217; he said, &#8216;by his policy doth propose,
and God at His will doth dispose.&#8217; Con O&#8217;Donnell and
Maguire, who were already well affected, had been sworn to
continue so; but no general confederacy had been formed
against Shane, and the impotence of the military administration
had been demonstrated once more. Yet Sussex thought
himself justified in saying that the credit of the army had
been restored, though no enemy had been seen, because Shane
had lost 5,000 cows, and had been forced to fly from wood to
wood. The cunning chief was only waiting till the transient
effort of civilisation was exhausted, and he soon attacked
Meath, in fulfilment of his promise to Lord Slane. Some
villages were burned, and Sir James Garland, a gentleman of
importance who had ventured to stray from his armed company,
was taken prisoner. A brother of Macmahon was with
Shane, and we are told that 1,000 cows were taken from his
tribe in revenge; but the result of all the operations was to
prove that Sussex could neither conquer Ulster nor even
defend the Pale.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare
makes a
truce with
Shane.</div>

<p>When Shane was returning practically victorious to Tyrone,
Kildare brought a letter authorising him to treat and coax
O&#8217;Neill to visit England. Fitzwilliam had already brought a
conditional pardon. Sussex was ordered to co-operate cordially
with the Earl, who lost no time in seeking a meeting
with Shane. Accompanied by Lords Baltinglass, Slane, and
Louth, he came to Carrickbradagh, the usual place of meeting;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
but Shane was in bad humour, and would listen to nothing.
Next day he proved more amenable, and the conversation
resulted in his making a written offer of terms, to which Kildare
agreed with a readiness for which he was afterwards
blamed. The arrangement was generally condemned in
official circles, and was, with difficulty, accepted by the Lord-Lieutenant
and Council. Yielding everything and suggesting
nothing, it was said that Kildare had shown no regard for the
Queen&#8217;s honour, taken no pains to fight her battle, and consented
to abandon Armagh, for the retention of which he
should have held out to the last. The Earl merely answered
that the thing was done and could not be undone, and he had
certainly full power to treat.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrangement
for
Shane&#8217;s
visit to
England.</div>

<p>It was agreed that Kildare and Ormonde should meet
Shane, and remain in his company till he came to the Queen&#8217;s
presence. His passport to go and return safely was to be
signed by the five Irish Earls, who were to undertake for the
safety of his dependents in his absence. Kildare in particular
undertook that the soldiers of Armagh, upon whose immediate
withdrawal Shane did not insist, should do no harm until after
the appointed meeting. A sum of money was to be advanced
by Ormonde and Kildare, and paid through the latter. No
Irishman owing Shane allegiance was to be maintained against
him, and if such a person drove his cattle into the Pale it was
to be restored. In return he was to go to the Queen, giving
the very hostages which had been before rejected, and to
forbear taking vengeance on Maguire and others. Shane
refused any alteration in these terms; what he had written
he had written. It was retorted that &#8216;seeing he would put
no more in writing than was in writing already, he should
look for the performance of all things written and of nothing
else.&#8217; Shane&#8217;s own terms were granted, but there was little
goodwill or sincerity on either side.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Having practically humiliated the Lord-Lieutenant, Kil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>dare
had enough address to give the Queen the appearance of
a diplomatic triumph. It had been agreed that the garrison
should be withdrawn from Armagh, but the Earl persuaded
Shane that by not insisting strictly on this article he would
put her Majesty in good humour and make her favourable to
his suits. After expressing some indignation that any attempt
should be made to vary the written letter, Shane was at last
graciously pleased to humour the Queen, &#8216;but as to th&#8217;erle of
Sussex he would not molefye one yoote of his agrements;
and hereupon sent his man the garison to remaynge.&#8217; Five
hundred pounds were paid over to Shane before starting,
1,000<i>l.</i> awaited him at Chester, and a second 500<i>l.</i> in London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">visiting
Sussex on
the way.</div>

<p>Shane came to Dublin and waited upon Sussex, who
received him graciously; but this outward politeness scarcely
concealed the real feelings of the two men. Shane perhaps
feared that the Lord-Lieutenant, who now had him in his
power, might after all send him over as a prisoner. For the
same reason an encouraging letter from Mary Stuart, which
only reached him in Dublin, had not the desired effect of
preventing his journey. And thus, accompanied by Kildare
and Ormonde, without whose escort he had positively refused
to stir, and with a train suitable to his pretensions, the uncrowned
monarch of Ulster took ship to visit that great
princess whose authority even he was ready to acknowledge,
upon the sole condition that she should never exercise it.
Shane afterwards complained that he was treated as a prisoner
on the journey, and that Sussex had charged the Earls on
their allegiance to secure him by handcuffs.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Unpopularity
of
English
rule.</div>

<p>Sussex did not conceal from the Queen his mortification
at the treaty which he had been obliged to sign, at the powers
given to Kildare, and at the abandonment of the campaign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
from which so much had been hoped, and for which such
great preparations had been made. Her Majesty&#8217;s letters had
contained expressions of disgust which not only reflected on
himself, but discredited the whole English interest of which
he was the head, and he bitterly resented the small thanks
given him for five years of arduous service. &#8216;Our nation in
this realm,&#8217; he said, &#8216;is likened to the French in Scotland.
We be railed on at tables with terms not sufferable. The
people be incensed to wax mad, and this is hoped to be the
jubilee year.&#8217; He complained that the Queen&#8217;s Irish policy
was as useless and unprogressive as Penelope&#8217;s web, woven
by one governor only to be picked to pieces by the next. It
would be for the Queen&#8217;s honour either to support her representative
cordially, or to recall him honourably and employ
him in some other place, &#8216;where I can do her better service
than I can now do here.&#8217; These criticisms were well deserved.
The peace with Shane was of Elizabeth&#8217;s own making, and
yet, with that want of generosity which she sometimes showed,
she tried to make out that its terms were not sufficiently
favourable to her. Sussex showed conclusively that he had
done the best thing possible under the circumstances which
the Queen had thought proper to create.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane
O&#8217;Neill at
Court,
1562.</div>

<p>No sooner was Shane gone than Sussex obtained leave to
follow him. The Government was left to Fitzwilliam, whose
expenses were to be borne out of the pay and allowances of
the absent Lord-Lieutenant, and who was directed to give all
possible help to Brian O&#8217;Neill. It was perhaps thought profound
policy to support the boy&#8217;s claim to the Earldom of
Tyrone while the real chief of Ulster was out of the way.
Sussex rightly observed that if the Queen wished to support
the young Earl she could best do so by treating Shane coldly
at first, and by keeping him at arm&#8217;s length till he himself
arrived. This advice, which was not only sound in itself but
calculated to restore the credit of Sussex in Ireland, came too
late to be of much use; for Kildare had already presented
Shane to the Queen. The bare rough heads of his gallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>glasses,
who did not lay aside their axes, their long curls,
their wide-sleeved saffron shirts, their short tunics, and their
shaggy cloaks of fur or frieze, which in Ireland covered a
multitude of sins, made Englishmen stare; not less, says
Camden, than they now stare at Chinamen or American
Indians. The Ambassadors of Sweden and Savoy were
present, and doubtless shared in the general astonishment
created by her Majesty&#8217;s distinguished subject. Shane prostrated
himself before the Queen, and then on his knees
&#8216;confessed his rebellion with howling,&#8217; and made his submission
in Irish, which few or none could understand. The
language was perhaps less humble than the posture. But
Cecil was not to be put off thus; the supposed meaning of
the speech was engrossed in English, and two days afterwards
was signed and sealed by Shane. &#8216;For lack of education
and civility,&#8217; he is made to say, &#8216;I have offended.&#8217; He
thanked the Queen for his pardon, promised to deserve well
for the future, begged her favour for the gentlemen of his
company, his kinsmen and friends, and admitted in writing
that he had done homage on his knees to Elizabeth as Queen
of England, France, and Ireland. Shane&#8217;s pretensions were
so extraordinary that the courtiers exercised their wit in inventing
a style for him, and they dubbed him &#8216;O&#8217;Neill the
great, cousin to St. Patrick, friend to the Queen of England,
enemy to all the world besides.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations
with
Shane in
England.</div>

<p>Sussex received a copy of Shane&#8217;s submission at Holyhead,
forwarded it to Fitzwilliam, and then went on to London; a
journey which bad weather and bad roads extended to about
ten days. On his arrival he had to defend himself against
those who had tied his hands by the commission to Kildare,
and who now blamed him for not using them more vigorously
against Shane. He showed very conclusively that he had
done his best under the circumstances, and threw the blame
on the Irish Earl, who was entirely responsible for the terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of the treaty. Either Kildare made good his case, or it was
not thought prudent to follow the matter up closely; for there
seems no reason to suppose that he was censured. With the
help of Sussex, Cecil immediately set himself to discover
the points on which Shane differed from the Government.
Written interrogatories were drawn up and answered by
Shane; and then the Lord-Lieutenant replied. The nature
of the controversy will be best understood from an abstract
of the papers, which bring out very clearly how entirely
different were the English and Irish points of view.</p>

become civilised by the sight of her Majesty&#8217;s nobility.</p>

<p><i>R.</i> The implied accusation is too vague.</p>

<p>2. Shane has been profuse in offering his services&mdash;what
are they?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To help the Governor in preventing foreign enemies
from landing in the North. Sussex has brought in the
Redshanks &#8216;to the great danger of the Crown of Ireland.&#8217;
Their lands should be restored to loyal subjects such as me,
O&#8217;Neill, and my friends.</p>

<p><i>R.</i> Judging from Shane&#8217;s antecedents, is he likely to
perform such a promise?</p>

<p>3. Why should not the Baron&#8217;s son be Earl according to
his patent?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That Kelly was born in wedlock and reputed the son
of John Kelly and Alison his wife until sixteen. He was
adopted by my father &#8216;contrary to all order of law and to
the old proverb "who bulleth my cow the calf is mine."&#8217;
Matthew Kelly was then a trader in Dundalk called &#8216;Matthew
the seller of salt.&#8217; My father rechristened Matthew, &#8216;Ferdoragh,&#8217;
who then tried to usurp the headship of the O&#8217;Neills.
Even if I were out of the way there are one hundred of my
name who would not allow Matthew&#8217;s pretensions.</p>

<p>Any patent must be void, for Con had no estate in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
country, which was held only by consent of the Lords and
inhabitants.</p>

<p>By the law of the Pale no letters patent took effect
without inquisition, which could not be held in Tyrone
because it was no shire. If &#8216;the Queen&#8217;s law&#8217; is to prevail,
then I am heir-at-law.</p>

<p><i>R.</i> The Baron&#8217;s son claims by letters patent, not by
legitimation, and the freeholders were consenting parties.
Shane&#8217;s Pale law is &#8216;used in shire-ground and not in the
Irishry, where the Prince holdeth by conquest, and ever hath
done, and the breach thereof overthrows all the new Earls&#8217;
states in Ireland.&#8217;</p>

<p>4. How he proves his title to be O&#8217;Neill, having never
been admitted by the sovereign?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> In Tyrone and most Irish countries the people assemble
on the death of a chief and choose &#8216;the most ablest and the
worthiest of the headmen.&#8217; Shane was so elected without
the usual contest. His ancestors never used to be confirmed
by the Crown, &#8216;yet none the less do I mean to be as good and
true a subject as though any such confirmation were had in
that behalf.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>R.</i> The eldest is not accounted the worthiest, but the
strongest. Shane forced the country to elect him. There
are many precedents for the admission of captains of countries
by letters patent, and the practice should of right be
universal.</p>

<p>5. What authority and jurisdiction does Shane claim by
virtue of tribal election?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> What my ancestors have always claimed and no more.
Most of them have held the pre-eminence by indenture, and
the old men of the country will not deny the extent of the
jurisdiction.</p>

<p><i>R.</i> The claim is bad, and more particulars are required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane&#8217;s
&#8216;Urraghs,&#8217;
according
to himself.</div>

<p>6. What countries doth Shane claim to rule thereby?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Magennis, MacMahon, Maguire, O&#8217;Kane, O&#8217;Hanlon,
MacCartane, Dufferin, the Savages, and many O&#8217;Neills are
under my rule. Clandeboye and the Rowte should belong to
me, &#8216;which the Scot engageth by the means aforesaid.&#8217; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
have also ancient rights over O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s country, and rents
out of &#8216;other lords of small reputation which it were prolix
to write.&#8217; The old black rent of 40<i>l.</i> out of Louth was remitted
by my father. Whatever men may say, I mean to
spend all my power in the Queen&#8217;s service.</p>

<p><i>R.</i> Fuller particulars are required, and records are extant
to disprove all these claims.</p>

<p>7. What obedience and service hath O&#8217;Neill hitherto borne
to the Crown of Ireland?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Bare allegiance only to the Lords of Ireland, and peace
with the Pale. My father first acknowledged Henry VIII. King
of England, France, and Ireland; I do the same &#8216;with a more
perfection&#8217; to serve her Majesty than my ancestors. When
I undertook to come I fully knew what influence the Earl of
Sussex had with the nobility. Nevertheless, I had &#8216;hope in
the Queen&#8217;s Highness and the uprightness of her honourable
Council, and my own truth.&#8217; I now crave favour and despatch.</p>

<p><i>R.</i> All this is false. O&#8217;Neill owes great service to the
Crown of Ireland as appears by record.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Personal
differences
between
Shane and
Sussex.</div>

<p>Other controversies there were of a more personal character
between Shane and Sussex; a study of which shows how
hopeless it was to suppose that they would ever act together,
or be anything but enemies to each other. Shane declared
truly enough that Sussex had designs on his life. His charges
may be summed up in the statement that he thoroughly mistrusted
the Lord-Lieutenant, &#8216;by reason of which mistrust he
hath escaped his traps, by the help of God and grace of the
Queen, and now at length come to her gracious presence,
which he hath long wished.&#8217; Refuting some charges and
denying others, the Earl concentrates his wrath in the supposition
&#8216;that Shane&#8217;s nature is so accustomed to lying, as
after her Majesty&#8217;s gracious dealing with him he is not
ashamed to show the same now in her presence;&#8217; and is
therefore much less to be trusted when absent.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

of
Shane&#8217;s
detention.</div>

<p>That Cecil was anxious to do right in O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s case may
be inferred from the great labour which he evidently took to
understand both the legal and moral aspect of the question.
The &#8216;Tower Records&#8217; were searched for precedents as to the
Earldom of Ulster, through which Edward IV. and all his
successors were entitled to Tyrone, and as to the relations of
the Crown with Irish captains. Inquiries into Irish customs
were also set on foot with special reference to Shane&#8217;s claims
under them. His proved rights there was clearly no intention
of withholding. But there was culpable procrastination, a
hope that something might turn up, and an idea that it was
well to keep Shane away from his own country and to accustom
his country to do without him. O&#8217;Neill clamoured for
his release, and produced evidence of the distractions of his
country in his absence. Many spoils were taken to the Pale,
and many disturbances raised by the Baron of Dungannon&#8217;s
sons and by other enemies. Tirlough Luineach took too
much on himself; &#8216;and the sept of the Neills,&#8217; said the chief&#8217;s
correspondent, &#8216;do not maintain one another but are scattered
abroad, every one doing for himself, and the "kereaghts" of
the country (the nomad herdsmen of Ulster) in every side
are dropping away to eschew the trouble of the country ...
every man spake largely for the defence of the country at
your being with them, yet is the country now evil defended.
It is easier to redress now than hereafter, therefore come in
haste and do as the proverb says, "Principiis obsta; sero medicina
paratur," come with haste and you shall be welcome.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Murder of
the Baron
of Dungannon.</div>

<p>The Queen not unreasonably declared that she could not
decide fairly in the young Baron&#8217;s absence; but this should
have been thought of before. About the time the order to
send him reached Ireland the question was settled as between
Shane and his nephew, or supposed nephew, by the murder
of the younger claimant to the Earldom of Tyrone. Tirlough
Luineach, who was probably tanist, and was certainly the
second man among the O&#8217;Neills, waylaid the unfortunate boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
before daybreak with 100 horse and 200 foot, somewhere
between Carlingford and Newry. The victim had no more
than twenty with him. He hid in a thicket, and stripped off
his clothes, intending to swim the river, when the pursuit
slackened. But one of his followers who was taken offered,
to save his own life, to betray a better person. His hiding-place
was soon found, and he was killed, &#8216;not far, as I think,&#8217;
said Fitzwilliam, &#8216;from the spot where his father had the like
friendship of his men.&#8217; Brian O&#8217;Neill left a brother behind
him, who was neglected on account of his youth, but who
lived to be the most formidable of all Elizabeth&#8217;s Irish enemies.
The murder could not be traced to Shane; and indeed
Tirlough, as his presumptive successor, had an interest of his
own in getting rid of a pretender who relied on letters patent.
Under Tirlough&#8217;s leadership the O&#8217;Neills did nearly as much
harm as when Shane was present, and the last crime was
considered evidence that no one but the latter could keep
order.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">What
Shane did
in London.</div>

<p>We have but scanty information as to how Shane spent
his time in London. He was present at a Court hunting
party, where he saw a brother of Guise, who was on his way
home from Scotland, kill two stags with a single arrow. A
diarist of the time has recorded that one day &#8216;John O&#8217;Neill,
the wild Irishman, came riding into Cheapside, and dined at
St. John&#8217;s Head, at Master Daniel&#8217;s, the goldsmith;&#8217; and that
on another day he ran at the ring beyond St. James&#8217;s in the
field. No doubt Shane rode well enough in the field; but
probably he did not shine in the tilt-yard; for he asked the
Queen, until she had found him an English wife to amuse
him, to appoint him &#8216;to attend on the Lord Robert, that I
may learn to ride after the English fashion, to run at the
tilt, to hawk, to shoot, or use such other good exercises as I
perceive my said good lord to be meet unto.&#8217; This may not
have been unpleasing to the Queen, and was certainly not so
to the favourite, who afterwards corresponded with Shane.
O&#8217;Neill sent him hawks, horses, and greyhounds, and thanked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
him for his gentle and loving letters. Shane did not get the
wife &#8216;to be chosen by the Queen such as she and I may agree,&#8217;
and he may have ceased to press the matter when he found
that he might be expected to &#8216;change his garments, and go
like an Englishman.&#8217; Nothing was further from his thoughts
than to conform to English customs, either in dress or religion,
and he was in constant communication with the Spanish
ambassador De Quadra, who encouraged him to hope for
Philip&#8217;s favour, and took care that he should not want the
means of confession and absolution, which he must have
required pretty often. The interpreter at these interviews
was an Irish priest, who afterwards went to Louvain, and
thence to Spain or Rome. One supposed consequence of his
journey was that the Holy See gave Shane all the ecclesiastical
patronage in his country.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane
returns to
Ireland.</div>

<p>Shamed or frightened by the death of the young Baron,
the Queen at last let her barbarous subject go. He was
acknowledged, with a formal reservation of young Hugh
O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s claims, as actual captain not only of Tyrone, but of
O&#8217;Cahan&#8217;s county, and of the greater part of what is now the
county of Antrim; but with a proviso that he should not
levy Irish exactions outside of his own proper district. He
promised to do his best to persuade the chiefs thus placed
under him to come to Dublin and do homage, and to support
those who thus evinced their loyalty against those who refused
to do so. Shane agreed to attend all general hostings in
Ulster, and to keep the peace with O&#8217;Donnell, O&#8217;Reilly, and
the rest for six months, during which a board of arbitration,
consisting of the Earls of Kildare and Ormonde, and of four
members of the Irish Privy Council, two named by himself
and two by the opposite party, should sit and determine all
differences. O&#8217;Neill promised to retain no mercenaries born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
out of Tyrone, and to take no pledges beyond the same limits.
Phelim Roe&#8217;s sons, and others in Tyrone who had done the
Queen service, were not to be molested, and internal disputes
were to be settled by arbitrators; the powers of an umpire
being retained by the Council, who might send Commissioners
to the border. Shane covenanted not to molest the garrison
of Armagh, on condition that they were victualled out of the
Pale. He consented to bring Calvagh O&#8217;Donnell into the
presence of the Earls of Ormonde, Kildare, Thomond, and
Clanricarde, and to submit to their decision as to Calvagh&#8217;s
liberation, and as to other matters in dispute. Such was the
general tenor of the treaty: it was one which could not work
well without complete good faith on both sides. The Queen
probably acted under the advice of Sidney and of his brother-in-law
Dudley, and this may have laid the foundation of the
bad feeling afterwards existing between Sidney and Sussex.
Shane was indeed completely triumphant. He left three hostages
in London, but as they were all persons of no importance,
he probably made the sacrifice with great equanimity.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
puzzled.</div>

<p>Unfortunately, good faith existed on neither side. Elizabeth
dismissed Shane with honour because she knew not
what else to do, and Shane agreed to her terms because he
was in the net and saw no other means of escape. Three
hundred pounds certainly, perhaps more, was lent, or rather
given, for the return journey, and the Queen issued a proclamation
declaring Shane&#8217;s virtues, and appointing Commissioners
to determine his controversies with the Pale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
and
Ormonde.</div>

<p>Shortly before Sussex left Ireland Munster was disturbed
by the chronic jealousy between Butlers and Geraldines.
Desmond accused Ormonde of waylaying him on his return
from the great hosting, and thereupon invaded his country;
but a peremptory order from the Lord-Lieutenant averted a
collision for the time. Ormonde went to Sussex when sent
for, but Desmond, while professing his readiness to obey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
kept out of reach, and made Lord Roche and Lord Barry
swear allegiance to him. Sussex recommended that both
the Earls should be sent for to England as the only means to
save the whole South-West from disorder, which nothing
short of a regular campaign could repress. Ormonde was
willing to incur the expense of the journey, for he was in an
awkward dilemma. Either he must allow his country to be
wasted with impunity, or he must incur the Queen&#8217;s displeasure
by attempting to defend it.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
shows signs
of insubordination.</div>

<p>On receiving his patent as Lord Justice, Fitzwilliam was
able to say that Shane&#8217;s departure had made an instantaneous
peace. Ormonde had shown extraordinary obedience and
forbearance, or his rival&#8217;s wilfulness and pride would have
made great work. The usual causes of disturbance were still
present, and the vacillation of the English Government confirmed
the evil disposition of a people who, in Sir H. Radclyffe&#8217;s
opinion, were naturally &#8216;addicted to sedition, desirous of alteration,
contented with nothing but will and liberty.&#8217; Desmond
was at war with all the gentlemen of the West, and they with
him. The outlaws maintained by him burned towns and
carried all their plunder into his country, where there was no
danger of rescue. Ormonde had been ready to accompany
Shane O&#8217;Neill to England, but the Queen had ordered him
to wait for Desmond, lest he might leave his country exposed.
The Geraldine Earl urged as a reason for staying at home
that he was at war with his uncle Maurice, who bore the
significant title of &#8216;na totane,&#8217; or the incendiary, and whose
propensities age had not tamed. The pretext was taken
away by Thomas Fitzmaurice, who went to England and
promised for himself and for his father to keep the peace
during Desmond&#8217;s absence. The Earl was reported to have
said that he would never be in England at the same time
with Kildare and O&#8217;Neill, the inference being that they had
all an interest in disorder. Summoned by a letter from the
Queen herself, Desmond did not answer for nearly a month,
and then put in mere dilatory pleas, while he burned villages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and robbed Ormonde&#8217;s people of 500<i>l.</i> collected for his expenses
in England. The two Earls met Fitzwilliam at Waterford,
and Desmond dared the Lord Justice to interfere with the
pirates who infested the Blackwater. He promised, however,
that they should do no harm, and the Corporations of Cork,
Kinsale, and Youghal declared that he was their only defence.
The Lord Deputy and Council, said the Kinsale people, were so
far off that they would rather lose their rights than hazard
their lives to maintain them, and they made this their excuse
for addressing the Queen directly. Desmond promised to go to
England at Easter, and with this Fitzwilliam had to be content.
Like Shane O&#8217;Neill, the Geraldine was willing to keep some
order, provided he was not interfered with when he proposed
to build a castle in Lord Roche&#8217;s country. Fitzwilliam could
see only rebellious intentions, but the people probably preferred
one tyrant to many, and the known shortcomings of
Desmond to the fluctuating policy of Lords-Lieutenant and
Lords Justices. Determined to show no politeness to Fitzwilliam,
Desmond slipped away at last without his knowledge,
and Ormonde went over about the same time. In spite of
his professions of poverty, Desmond was accompanied by an
immense retinue.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzwilliam&#8217;s
gloomy
view of
Ireland.</div>

<p>Fitzwilliam took a very gloomy view of the country
committed to his charge. He was, he said, a banished man
wearing himself out among unkind people, a people most
accursed, who lusted after every sin. Murder and incest were
everyday matters, and a lying spirit brooded over all the
land. It was difficult to make out any man&#8217;s pedigree or
title; for heraldry was discountenanced, records destroyed
or embezzled, and everyone greedy for the reputation conferred
by rhymers, whose trade was to set forth &#8216;the most
beastliest and odious parts of men&#8217;s doings and their own
likewise, for whom the rhymes be made; such be cherished,
defended, and rewarded with garments till they leave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>selves
naked, besides the best piece of plate in the house, and
chiefest horse away with them, not altogether departing
empty-handed when they come among the Earls and others
the nobility of English race.&#8217; The English Pale was,
indeed, in a dreadful state, every one prophesying a total
change of policy, and refusing to obey any law. Pirates infested
the sea, blockading Cork and Kinsale, and even lying
openly under Lambay, while the Queen&#8217;s ships were nowhere
visible. Robbery and arson were commonly committed with
impunity. Thus Richard Keating, whose family had for
generations given their service as swordsmen to the Earls of
Kildare, amassed great wealth by preying on the property of
the English settlers in Wexford. No one exerted himself to
make the Keatings disgorge their ill-gotten gains, fearing the
vengeance of their great patron, and even Ormonde was unwilling
to press them hard. &#8216;There be such with us,&#8217; said
Fitzwilliam, &#8216;as can serve two masters, and neither truly.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish
lawyers.
Jobbing.</div>

<p>Most important families had friends in official circles, and
among the lawyers the jobbing was frightful. Records were
made away with or altered, so that of seven attainders affecting
the Crown&#8217;s title to land, not one could be proved by
documentary evidence. The judges were not above suspicion,
and public justice had little chance against well-connected
individuals. &#8216;There is,&#8217; said the Lord Justice, &#8216;neither
judge, counsellor-at-law, nor any gentleman who is not by
blood or marriage very near linked together, and though I
cannot accuse any for doing things contrary to their conscience
or corruptly, yet have I seen such things pass, whether for
kindred&#8217;s sake or neighbourhood I know not, but sure I am
no man out of Ireland in the like case but would have made
some stay for colour sake at least.&#8217; Where private interests
were to be forwarded, decisions were given with indecent
haste, while Crown business was systematically delayed.
Fitzwilliam saw and described abuses clearly, but he had too
much experience of Ireland to dream of a speedy reform. He
had come with sanguine expectations, but had learned that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
man may wear to skin and bones without effecting anything.
The English Government had aggravated the difficulty by
sending over officials of small parts or credit, far inferior to
those born in Ireland. &#8216;Let those sent hereafter,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;be as good as the best here,&#8217; and let &#8216;every one that comes
bid farewell to peace and quiet.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">State of
the Pale.
Memorial
of Irish
law
students.</div>

<p>Queen Elizabeth might show clemency or policy by her
treatment of Shane O&#8217;Neill, by ignoring Kildare&#8217;s intrigues
and utilising him in her service, and by summoning Desmond
and Ormonde to submit their controversies to her personal
arbitrament; but she could not close her ears to the complaints
which reached her as to the state of the English Pale. It was
then, as it still is, the custom for Irish students to keep some
terms in London, to study the common law at head-quarters,
and to carry back legal traditions and modes of thought to their
own country. The bar was the recognised road to power and
influence, and young men of family chose it almost as a matter
of course. Twenty-seven of these students signed a memorial
specifying the miserable state of the Pale, and this document
was delivered to the Privy Council. Among the names of the
signataries we find Talbot, Bathe, Dillon, Barnewall, Burnell,
Fleming, Netterville, Wesley, or Wellesley, and others scarcely
less known. The complaints were arranged under twenty-four
heads, and interrogatories were delivered to Sussex, who
made the best answer he could to each. The first article set
forth that the whole expense of the Government and forts
was nominally borne by Dublin, Kildare, Meath, West Meath,
and Louth; but that West Meath and Louth hardly paid anything,
and that the real weight rested on the three first only.
To this it was answered that Carlow and Wexford were contributory,
and that there was also some help derived from
Irish countries: poverty there might be, but not caused by
the soldiers; otherwise why should West Meath, where there
were seldom any troops, be the least peaceful county of all?
The rejoinder was that Wexford and Carlow sometimes paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
a trifle under protest, that the Lord Deputy sometimes lived
at Leighlin Bridge, with the express object of getting something
out of the country irregularly, and that West Meath
suffered from Irish exactions, to which the Marshal and Cowley,
the Governor of Philipstown, were parties. Forced labour for
insufficient pay, free quarters for soldiers, goods taken far
below the market price, coyne and livery, private jobbing
under colour of the public service&mdash;such were the principal
heads under which the law students arranged their heavy
indictment. No doubt there was exaggeration, and in some
cases Sussex was able to give a conclusive answer; but the
students admitted that writing at a distance they made no
claim to infallibility, and craved indulgence for mistakes,
preferring to incur blame rather &#8216;than that the miserable
estate of our poor country should not be known to our gracious
Queen.&#8217; They courted the fullest inquiry, and they certainly
made a case strong enough to startle a sovereign who could
never be justly accused of neglecting her subjects&#8217; welfare.
Lord Robert Dudley, glad no doubt of an opportunity to
annoy Sussex, and perhaps supplied with information by
Sidney, supported the students; but the general official voice
was loud and confident against them, and a rumour reached
Ireland that the Queen gave no heed to their complaints.
Thereupon twenty-seven gentlemen of the Pale addressed
Elizabeth directly, supporting the original charges, protesting
that their poverty and not their will made them impatient of
taxation, and confiding in the Queen&#8217;s readiness to learn the
misery of her subjects, &#8216;yea, from the basest sort.&#8217; They demanded
an independent commission of inquiry, and begged
that their interests might be represented by Lord Baltinglass
and John Parker, Master of the Rolls in Ireland, himself an
Englishman, but a bitter critic of Sussex and his government,
and in their estimation a just and upright man.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Martial
law.</div>

<p>One complaint of the students deserves special mention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
They alleged that martial law interfered with the regular tribunals,
and being pressed for particulars they stated positively
&#8216;that Sir Ralph Bagenal, being lieutenant of the army,
was for killing of a soldier arraigned at the King&#8217;s Bench,
who pleaded his pardon. Whether justice hath been done
by the Marshal of soldiers complained on to that we say that
the man before mentioned to have been arraigned at the
King&#8217;s Bench, and attempted to be taken thence by the
Marshal, but upon resistance of the judges stayed and committed
to gaol, was after by the Marshal taken from thence,
and had none other punishment than put on the pillory,
muffled, as it should seem, lest he might be known, which we
count rather a mockery than execution of justice.&#8217; No answer
in effect was given to this heavy charge, but that the Marshal
had authority over the military, and that the Governor had
orders to maintain him. If the lawyers in Dublin were guilty
of factious opposition to the Government, they were not altogether
without excuse.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
in London.</div>

<p>Encouraged probably by the success of Shane O&#8217;Neill,
Desmond behaved in London very much as he had behaved
at Waterford. Being charged before the Council with openly
defying the law in Ireland, he answered contumaciously, and
when called to order refused to apologise. He was accordingly
committed to the custody of the Lord Treasurer, on
hearing which Fitzwilliam expressed an opinion that Desmond
lacked both education and wit, and that the effect of bringing
him to such senses as he had would be most beneficial in
Ireland. &#8216;The news,&#8217; he said, &#8216;made some not only to change
colour, but greatly sigh, whose nature God amend, make them
banish flattery, malice, and other misdeeds.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Queen&#8217;s
views
about him.</div>

<p>The Queen wrote to Lady Desmond to complain of the
Earl&#8217;s inordinate conduct, and to state her conviction that a
little gentle imprisonment would do him good. Unheard-of
favour had been ill requited; nevertheless, the royal patience
was inexhaustible. No harm was intended to Desmond, and
his wife was charged to keep order until his return. Between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
her son and her husband, the position of the countess was
not pleasant. Fitzwilliam thought she did her best to hold
the balance, and keep the peace between them; but her
husband&#8217;s friends accused her of unduly favouring Ormonde,
an imputation which she indignantly denied. &#8216;I always,&#8217; she
declared with a certain pathos, &#8216;wished them to be perfect
friends, as two whom I love as myself.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Projects of
Sussex.</div>

<p>Sussex followed Shane O&#8217;Neill back to Ireland, taking
with him his sister, Lady Frances, the dainty bait at which
it was supposed that wary fish might rise. During his stay
at Court he had taught the Queen to see Ireland partly with
his eyes. About the desirability of abolishing illegal exactions
there could of course be no difference of opinion; and
Elizabeth was now further inclined to divide the country into
presidencies, to persuade the principal chiefs to take estates
of their lands and accept titles of honour, to hold a Parliament,
and to establish a Star Chamber. On other points she
was at issue with her Lord-Lieutenant. Thus Sussex wished
to expel Shane O&#8217;Neill absolutely from Ulster, to divide Tyrone
into three districts, to encourage and flatter the Scots as long
as their help was wanted, and then, with a refined duplicity,
to drive them out in their turn. Elizabeth was for making
the best of Shane, alluring him, if possible, to keep his promises.
The Presidency Courts when established were to administer
both law and equity. Sussex wished to acknowledge
what was good of the Brehon law, and by systematising it
gradually to accustom Irishmen to written and settled forms.
The Brehons he proposed to admit, not as arbitrators, but as
counsel entitled to receive fees; and by empanelling juries to
find the facts, he hoped in time to fuse the two systems
together. It is much to be regretted that this really statesmanlike
idea was not allowed to bear fruit. The difficulty of
getting juries to find verdicts against the members of powerful
factions was great in Elizabeth&#8217;s time, as it is now. Sussex
proposed to meet it by freely changing the venue from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
county to another, an obvious expedient which has only very
lately and by a subterfuge been partially introduced. The
constitutional pedantry of lawyers often stands in the way of
justice, for the furtherance of which they are themselves supposed
to exist.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
sends Commissioners
to report on
the Pale.</div>

<p>The Queen&#8217;s evident readiness to hear the complaints of
the Pale encouraged William Bermingham, who had his own
ideas of reform, and who was in correspondence with the Irish
law students. He went to London, and his representations
perhaps decided Elizabeth to send over a Commissioner with
authority and ability to discover the truth, and to report it
fearlessly. The person selected was Sir Nicholas Arnold,
Wyatt&#8217;s fellow-conspirator, a man of resolution and industry,
who cared little for popularity, and who might be trusted to
carry out his orders. Arnold was instructed to confer with
Lord Baltinglass and three others as to the county of Kildare,
with Lords Dunsany, Howth, and three others as to Meath
and Louth, and with Talbot of Malahide and three others as
to Dublin. Notwithstanding this success, Bermingham complained
bitterly that he had been ill-treated and his advice
slighted. If he had had full and favourable hearing he would
have showed how the Queen might save 30,000<i>l.</i> He was
45<i>l.</i> out of pocket by his journey, and had gained little or
nothing for the public. &#8216;I shall be the last of my country,&#8217; he
said, &#8216;that shall come hither again to complain or to declare
anything for the Prince&#8217;s commodity, although the occasion
be never so vehement.&#8217; Anxious to get home for the harvest,
Bermingham left London soon afterwards, overtook Arnold at
Harlech, where he was waiting for shipping, and presented him
with a long string of interrogatories proper, in his opinion,
to be administered to the Queen&#8217;s subjects in Ireland. The
insinuations were that martial law was grievous to the innocent,
and no terror to evil-doers, that officers and soldiers
oppressed the people, that false musters were habitually taken,
and that the Queen was kept in ignorance of the real state
of Ireland. There were many covert insinuations against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Sussex; and Arnold, when he reached his destination, was
thus forewarned against official statements, and perhaps
slightly prejudiced against the officials themselves.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Burdens of
the Pale.</div>

<p>The payment of cess for maintaining soldiers was the most
grievous of burdens. It was impossible to dispense with it
altogether; but Sussex suggested that a more economical
management of the Crown lands might furnish the means of
lightening it considerably. The Queen acquiesced, suspended
the granting of leases, and invited the Lord-Lieutenant to
consult with his Council as to the redemption of those which
were still unexpired. Commissioners were instructed to
summon the landowners, and to inform them that the Queen
was most anxious to lighten the cess; but that the monastic
lands had been improvidently leased, and that she had therefore
no sufficient revenue. If the country was inclined to buy
out some of the lessees, their farms might be re-let at such a
profit as to reduce the cess materially. The Commissioners,
who were chosen from among the chief families, reported adversely
to the scheme. The inhabitants of the Pale could not
afford money for such a small and uncertain benefit. If they
could be for ever relieved of all military burdens by letters
patent, confirmed by Parliament, then they would make an
effort, but for nothing less. This could not be done, and the
matter dropped.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane
O&#8217;Neill
professes
loyalty.</div>

<p>Back in Ireland, with the consciousness that he had
gained a substantial victory, and that his most dangerous
enemy was dead, Shane O&#8217;Neill was at first in high good
humour; and he wrote courteously to the Lord Justice saying
that the Queen had enough men to inhabit her land, and
that his must go with himself. Fitzwilliam, who thought he
had not learned much in England, was glad that he showed
his hand so openly. Very soon the wording of the letters
became warmer. Shane set up a claim to correspond in future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
directly with the Queen, and there were signs that he was
already weary of well-doing, or rather of doing nothing.
When Sussex landed he found that there was but little chance
of the London articles being fully carried out. A meeting
was appointed at Dundalk, and Sussex began to cast about
for means to get Shane into his power by straining the language
of the safe-conduct, which was nevertheless full and
plain to every commonly candid understanding. The Dean
of Armagh, the intriguing Terence Danyell, went to confer
with Shane, and on his return dined with the Lord-Lieutenant.
After dinner he talked freely, advising his host not to trust
Shane, who would now be worse than ever, having rejected
the advice of all his principal clansmen to attend Sussex at
his landing. Shane complained with some reason of his
treatment in England, said he went there to get and not to
lose, demanded the withdrawal of the garrison from Armagh,
threatened to take back his MacDonnell wife and make friends
with the Scots once more, and nevertheless clamoured for
the hand of Lady Frances Radclyffe. Dean Danyell thought
Shane would not appear on the appointed day. Meanwhile,
at least 20,000 head of cattle belonging to the O&#8217;Donnells
were driven into Tyrone, and the O&#8217;Mores and O&#8217;Connors,
the miserable remnant of two powerful clans, hung upon
Shane&#8217;s words and waited for him to give the signal of
revolt.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The loyal

<p>On the day fixed for the execution of the indentures made
in England, the Lord-Lieutenant and Council repaired to
Dundalk; but no Shane appeared. Letters from him came
in plenty. He complained of hurts done during his absence,
asserted his right over Maguire, MacMahon, Magennis, and
others, and refused to come to Sussex if those rights were to
be disputed. Kildare, Clanricarde, and Thomond were deputed
to meet O&#8217;Neill, and to insist in temperate language
upon the performance of the articles. If the worst came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the worst, they were to procure a truce for six months between
him and his neighbours, and an open market for the garrison
of Armagh. The meeting led to nothing, and Shane withdrew
to his woods in high disdain. Maguire, O&#8217;Reilly, and
the rest, who, on the faith of English promises which could
not be performed, had hoped in vain for protection and peace,
&#8216;seeing him so proudly departed and not having received that
which they long had hoped on, for two or three years depending
continually on the Queen&#8217;s Majesty, did forthwith burst
out in so large, unseemly, and also lamentable talk, yea, in
effect cursing him that would believe any promise from the
Queen&#8217;s Highness, either by mouth or letter.... Old
O&#8217;Hanlon openly swore it were better to serve the worst
Irishman of Ulster than to trust unto the Queen. MacRandal
Boy, a Scot, who is as wise and subtle an Irishman as any
among them,&#8217; spoke to the same effect, and Maguire complained
bitterly of his losses, &#8216;both at the coming in of the
tide and going out of the same.&#8217; Sussex was almost ready
to advise that the loyal chiefs should be allowed at once to
submit to Shane, as the likeliest way to save some part of
their property.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ill-treatment
of
O&#8217;Donnell.</div>

<p>The Pale was not less hostile to Sussex than Tyrone itself,
and his policy was constantly counteracted from behind.
Robert Fleming, attorney of Drogheda, who had been employed
by Shane to bring his letters to Dundalk, sought a
private interview, and on being admitted to the Lord-Lieutenant&#8217;s
presence looked in every corner and under every
hanging to see that no one was listening. He declared that
if his evidence were known it would cost him his life. Sussex
gave him his word of honour not to disclose it, and he begged
the Queen to keep the secret. Fleming then said that Shane,
who had daily information out of the Pale, had heard of
Sussex bringing over his sister only to entrap him, and that
&#8216;if he came to any governor he should never return.&#8217; According
to Fleming, most of the nominally loyal Irish had a secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
understanding with Shane, who had agreed to keep Calvagh
O&#8217;Donnell a perpetual prisoner, and to make his son Con
chief. Con was to marry Shane&#8217;s daughter; the Macleans
were to give their services in ransom of the unfortunate
countess; O&#8217;Neill himself was to take back MacDonnell&#8217;s
daughter and marry her openly; and Sorley Boy was to seek
a foster-mother for his children among the O&#8217;Neills, to give
Shane great gifts, and to furnish a contingent of 400 or 500
men. Whether Fleming was intentionally deceiving Sussex,
or whether he really believed what he said, it is impossible to
say; but the Earl evidently gave him no credit as against
Con O&#8217;Donnell, whom he reported to be &#8216;the likeliest plant,&#8217;
as he thought, that ever sprang in Ulster to graft a good
subject on. Con himself wrote to the Queen begging for
help in earnest language, and telling her that he would rather
give himself up than see his father and mother in such
miserable captivity. The treatment of Shane&#8217;s prisoners was
indeed frightfully cruel. Calvagh had to wear an iron collar
round his neck fastened by a short chain to gyves on his
ankles, so that he could neither stand nor lie by day or night.
&#8216;Afterwards,&#8217; he said, &#8216;Shane thought to torment me after
another manner, to the intent that he might have all my
jewels, and so he caused the irons to be strained upon my legs
and upon my hands, so sore that the very blood did run down
on every side of mine irons, insomuch that I did wish after
death a thousand times.&#8217; Shane demanded Lifford as a ransom.
This was the stronghold which old Manus had built in
his best days, in spite of the O&#8217;Neills, and its surrender would
lay Tyrconnel at an invader&#8217;s feet. Shane could not be
trusted, for he had already plundered the O&#8217;Donnells treacherously
of 20,000 kine; nevertheless, it would be necessary
to try the &#8216;loathsome&#8217; experiment, unless the Queen could
help her own. Con spoke for himself, and for Maguire,
O&#8217;Reilly, MacMahon, Magennis, and O&#8217;Hanlon. The misery
of the loyal tribes could not be exceeded, and Con&#8217;s own
people were dying of starvation on the highways. Shane
was the tyrant of the North, inordinately ambitious, devoid of
truth, and stained with every vice. If only the Queen would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
bestir herself, &#8216;his pride,&#8217; said Con, &#8216;I hope shall have a
sudden fall.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane&#8217;s
violence.
Maguire.</div>

<p>While the Government hesitated O&#8217;Neill acted. He
attacked O&#8217;Reilly, swept 10,000 more cattle out of Tyrconnel,
though he had sworn to keep the peace, procured the escape
of his hostages from Dublin Castle, took away cattle from
Armagh and then contemptuously restored them, and
threatened the garrison itself. The MacDonnells were forced
for safety to make an agreement with Shane, and Sussex
returned to Dublin and wrote an official letter to Elizabeth.
This humiliating despatch was in fact dictated by Shane to
the Queen&#8217;s representative, whom he had outwitted, and
whom he now forced to write in his favour. It was followed
by another letter, in which Sussex advised Elizabeth to show
no mercy to the rebel: he had only written to stop Shane&#8217;s
mouth, and to gain time. Maguire described in piteous language
the outrages to which he was subjected, only for being
a loyal subject. Shane had crossed the Erne at Belleek and
burned corn and houses, falling upon the harvest people and
killing 300 men, women, and children. &#8216;I am,&#8217; Maguire
had written to Sussex, &#8216;upon my keeping every day since his
coming to Ireland. In his absence I might do him much
hurt, if it were not for fear of your Lordship&#8217;s displeasure.
Shane made offers to me, but my answer was that I will
never forsake your Lordship, till your honour do forsake me.
Except your Lordship will see to these matters Shane will
come to destroy my country, and I shall be cast away, or else
I must yield myself unto him.&#8217; The invasion had now taken
place; and Hugh O&#8217;Donnell, to whom Belleek belonged, was
afraid to offer any resistance. He thought it safer to join
Shane, and Fermanagh was at the mercy of these two. &#8216;I
told Shane,&#8217; said Maguire, &#8216;that I would never forsake you
till you had forsaken me first; wherefore he began to wax
mad, setting all on fire, and did never spare neither church
nor sanctuary. He could not pass westward where my cattle
were, because I stopped the passage with the help of certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
hagbuteers that I have. Shane O&#8217;Neill should never have
the power to banish me, except it had been through Hugh
O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s castles, that stand in the borders of my country.
I desire your Lordship to see to my great losses, which is innumerable
to be reckoned. For I promise you, and you do
not see the rather to Shane O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s business, ye are likely
to make him the strongest man of all Ireland, for everyone
will take an example by my great losses. Wherefore take
heed to yourselves betimes, for he is likely, with the help of
Hugh O&#8217;Donnell, to have all the power from this place till he
come to the walls of Galway, to rise against you.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ulster at
Shane&#8217;s
mercy.</div>

<p>O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s tyranny was certainly hateful to his neighbours,
who protested their loyalty and prayed earnestly for help.
Maguire begged Sussex to write only in English, for clerks,
&#8216;or other men of the country,&#8217; might know his mind if he
used Latin. The poor man seems not to have had a horse
left to ride, and was fain to beg one of the Lord-Lieutenant,
who sent him an animal for which he had given the high
price of twenty-four marks sterling. The prevalence of
official corruption is seen here, for the horse actually delivered
was worthless. A similar mishap seems to have befallen four
hand-guns. Nothing was left in Fermanagh, Shane&#8217;s machinery
for robbery and murder being perfect, except in some
islands in Lough Erne, and Hugh O&#8217;Donnell was preparing a
flotilla to harry these also, while the O&#8217;Neills lined the shores.
&#8216;I cannot,&#8217; said Maguire, &#8216;scape neither by land nor by water,
except God and your Lordship do help me at this need; all
my country are against me because of their great losses and
for fear, and all my men&#8217;s pleasure is that I should yield
myself to Shane.&#8217; It was a far cry to Lough Erne, and
Sussex could only enlarge upon the value of patience. To
Shane&#8217;s violence he could oppose nothing but intrigues. The
most brilliant expedient which occurred to him was to go to
Armagh during the moonlight nights, and there parley with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the enemy, so that he might not use them to plunder his
neighbours. A State policy which depends upon the phases
of every moon is really beneath criticism. January had been
marked by the wild man&#8217;s appearance at Court. December
left him with Ulster at his mercy, the Government baffled,
and all those who adhered to the Queen fugitives, prisoners,
or at the very least robbed of their goods, and hourly expecting
a worse fate.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arnold and
Sussex.</div>

<p>Like everyone who visits Ireland to learn the truth, Sir
Nicholas Arnold found there was a general desire to throw
dust in his eyes. The business of the musters proceeded very
slowly. Bermingham was unable to prove his allegations, or
many of them, and the gentry of the Pale began to think
that Sussex would, after all, come well out of the inquiry.
Sir Christopher Cheevers and others, who in the spring had
taken an active part in denouncing abuses, were in the autumn
anxious to persuade the Lord-Lieutenant that they had no
hand in Bermingham&#8217;s doings. Bermingham, said Sussex,
was Bermingham; the knave might do his worst, but his instigators
were better known than Sir Christopher and his
friends supposed. The musters were but a cloak for intrigue,
and he hoped the Queen would &#8216;command Bermingham&#8217;s ears
to the pillory for example, for the Earl of Sussex himself (so
much more being the Queen&#8217;s Lieutenant) was no person to
suffer to be threatened by a varlet to be touched in word, and
not to be touched in deed.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Recriminations.</div>

<p>Parker, the Master of the Rolls, who had strongly advocated
the cause of the Pale, was suspected of compiling
libellous pamphlets against the Lord-Lieutenant, and was
subjected to interrogatories on the subject. After much unseemly
wrangling at the Council Board in the presence of
Arnold, Parker at first refused to answer, and, being outvoted
on that point, asked a delay of two days, and then put in
merely a general denial, requiring special orders from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Queen before proceeding further. Had the Master of the
Rolls been his equal, Sussex told the Queen he would have
taken personal satisfaction, at the risk of his life and goods.
He could forgive plots against his life, &#8216;but he that seeketh
falsely to procure me to live discredited with you, and defamed
with the world, doth, I confess, touch me so near at
the bottom of the heart, as I may without offence, I trust, of
conscience, pursue the party to the uttermost by my own
truth and discover his falsehood.... The malicious
practices of Ireland seek first by secret and sinister means
to utter matter of slander, thinking that the same going without
punishment from hand to hand will breed to a common
rumour, and so (holpen with time) endure credit, whereby,
excepting indeed without punishment, they bring their intent
to effect and leave the honest slandered, which danger I most
humbly crave your Majesty to avoid from me, by open purgation
in this and in all other like matters.&#8217; It is true that
public men in Ireland have been at all times peculiarly
subject to baseless and self-seeking calumnies, and Sussex
may be freely acquitted of any dishonesty in his office; but
his indignation would better become him did not his own
letters convict him of the grossest treachery against an Irish
enemy. Was not Queen Elizabeth in truth far more deeply
disgraced by the conduct of her Lieutenant than by any
slanders which might pursue him in the fearless discharge of
his duty? It is evident that Cecil did not share the Lord-Lieutenant&#8217;s
feelings against Parker, for he continued to
consult him, and the Queen granted his suit for a lease of
certain lands.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evident
unfitness of
Sussex for
his work.</div>

<p>Among the many pie-crust promises of Shane O&#8217;Neill was
one not to attack Dundalk, and on the faith of it the townsmen
left their cattle in the fields, and lost them. Sussex
feared for the safety of the town, and offered a garrison of 400
foot and 100 horse, to be victualled at the Queen&#8217;s prices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
This was refused, the chance of losing all by Shane appearing
a less terrible alternative than the support of 500 soldiers for
three months. As the townsmen well knew, Sussex would be
obliged to do his best for them, whether they helped or not.
Nor were the Dundalk people altogether without excuse.
The best men in Ireland, even Ormonde himself, were loth
to incur expense which was almost sure to be followed by
failure. Sussex had shown too clearly that the Irish problem
was beyond his powers. He murmured at the general remissness.
&#8216;I pray God,&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;to rid me from serving
with such as speak with their mouths what they mislike with
their hearts, and put forth with their words that which they
overthrow with their deeds, of which mischievous and direful
practices I fear I shall hereafter bear the blame.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Great preparations
to attack
Shane.</div>

<p>Great exertions were made to collect two months&#8217; victuals
in the Pale, and in Wexford, Carlow, and Westmeath; and
to do it in the way least burdensome to the country. A
general hosting was ordered, but to avoid the cost of cartage
the bulk of the stores were sent by water to Newry and Carlingford,
and thence to Armagh by country ponies requisitioned
for the purpose. Five hundred labourers were taken out of the
Pale in the same way, to cut a pass in the woods between
Dundalk and Armagh. The season was a bad one, but great
hopes were excited, and the people professed willingness to
exert themselves to the utmost. A general hosting was
ordered. The Irish chiefs who were already committed against
Shane promised to do their best, and there were even hopes
of Tirlough Luineach, the second man in Tyrone.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Small
results.</div>

<p>At last the army moved. Its composition was so heterogeneous
that only a general of exceptional powers could hope
to lead it to advantage, and Sussex was not such a general.
The Keating kerne, the scourges of Wexford, did not agree
with their Northern congeners: an affray took place, and blood
was shed. There were small skirmishes with Shane&#8217;s men.
The soldiers chased a party to the edge of some bog or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
wood; then the wild horsemen appeared suddenly on all sides,
or shots were fired from behind turf-ricks, and a retreat was
beaten, seldom without loss. One day&#8217;s work was exactly like
another&#8217;s. A few cows were taken, but no real service was
done. For the first week the army lay encamped outside
Armagh, and one dark night, while the rain was falling in
torrents, a gang of thieves crept up to the lines and stole 300
pack-horses. This shameful negligence Sussex excused only
by the fact that it was Easter Monday, and that it had been
devoted to prayer, Sunday having been spent on the march.
He forgot the natural connection between watchfulness and
prayer. St. George&#8217;s Day was spent by the Lord-Lieutenant
in his tent, keeping the festival of the Garter; but the saint
seems not to have been propitiated. Perhaps he thought the
red cross should have been exhibited in the field. Three inglorious
weeks passed away, and at the end the provisions
were gone. The Blackwater had been crossed only for a few
hours, and the baffled Viceroy returned to the Pale to bemoan
his hard fate, and to lay the blame of failure upon every head
but the right one&mdash;namely, his own.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Treachery
of Andrew
Brereton
against the
MacDonnells.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the perfidy of his own intentions towards
them, Sussex expected the Scots to keep their promises made
through Hutchinson and Randolph. Piers, the indefatigable
constable of Carrickfergus, went both to Cantire and Red
Bay. At the latter place he made an arrangement with
James MacDonnell, by which the latter bound himself and
his brother Sorley Boy to send a contingent to Armagh.
Sussex had succeeded in making peace between the Scots and
Andrew Brereton, the turbulent farmer of Lecale, who had
called Tyrone traitor at the Council Board fourteen years
before. Alaster MacRandal Boy, the acknowledged chief of
the MacDonnells in that district, was a tried friend of the
English, and willingly accepted Brereton&#8217;s invitation to sup at
Ardglass. That same night a number of Scots, including the
chief and his brother Gillespie, were killed in their beds by
Brereton&#8217;s orders, and a third brother underwent the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
fate in another village. These murders of course destroyed
all hopes of help from the MacDonnells, and Scots and Irish
alike called loudly and justly for vengeance. &#8216;The voice is
common,&#8217; said Sussex, &#8216;that every Irishman that cometh to
the Queen&#8217;s service is either left undefended or murdered by
treason, which toucheth as much the surety of the Queen&#8217;s
order in this realm as the breach of my "slantie" toucheth
me in honour.&#8217; Brereton fled, having first sold his interest in
Lecale to the Earl of Kildare. It does not appear that he
was ever punished, and ten years afterwards we find the Lord
Deputy recommending him for a good service pension. Such
things did indeed touch the honour both of Queen Elizabeth
and of her most distinguished servants.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sussex can
obtain no
decisive
success.</div>

<p>After a fortnight&#8217;s rest Sussex again took the field. Led
by an O&#8217;Neill, his army crossed the Blackwater at Braintree,
and penetrated to Clogher. Some cattle were taken, but the
majority were driven off into Fermanagh, which was now quite
under Shane&#8217;s control. Provisions were short, and the raid,
for it was nothing more, was supported by the beasts taken.
Tirlough Luineach and the unfortunate Maguire met the
Lord-Lieutenant, but the former did not, and the latter could
not offer any effectual help. A general hosting was ordered,
but the overtaxed and desponding Pale scarcely answered the
call. The summons was repeated, and the Earls of Ormonde,
Desmond, Clanricarde, and Thomond, were directed to meet
the Lord-Lieutenant at Dundalk on June 14. In the meantime
Sussex collected a small force at Armagh, and advanced
to Dungannon. Tirlough Luineach was sent for; but he had
not been favourably impressed by his last interview, and he
did not come. A few O&#8217;Neills and a few soldiers, including
one English captain, were slain in skirmishes, some cows
were captured, and many ponies ham-strung. Shane hovered
in the neighbourhood and prepared a Caudine ambuscade
for Sussex near Lough Neagh. The Lord-Lieutenant escaped
by taking another road, and returned to Armagh to find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
MacMahon&#8217;s hostages had flown. On the way back to Dundalk
some plunder worth noting was taken, 3,000 kine and 1,600
stud mares belonging to the O&#8217;Neills, which had purposely
been mixed up with the MacMahons&#8217; property. MacMahon
sent to ask for peace. His request was granted, and he was
invited to attend the Lord-Lieutenant; but, like Tirlough
Luineach, he declined to respond. Sussex returned to Drogheda,
and on the same night Shane&#8217;s people plundered Henry
O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s property close to Dundalk. Such was the usual,
almost the inevitable end of these expeditions.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations.</div>

<p>The preparations of Sussex for a new invasion of Tyrone
led to nothing of importance. Negotiations were again tried,
and Ormonde and Kildare were sent to argue the point with
Shane. He agreed to a conference without listeners; there
to make only such proposals as in matter and manner were
worthy of a loving subject, and in sworn secrecy. The Earls
offered not to divulge his statements, except to the Lord-Lieutenant
and such of the Council as he should name. The
desired conference took place, but Shane stiffly declared that
he was not such a fool as to treat with the Scots without
proper securities from the Government. He again demanded
all that could be claimed by an O&#8217;Neill, and hinted to Ormonde
that he had some understanding with the southern Geraldines,
and that he might be worth conciliating.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cusack
makes a

Mortification
of
Sussex.</div>

<p>While Shane was defying the State in Ireland, Sir Thomas
Cusack was at Court advocating a conciliatory policy. In
desperation the Queen sent him back with large treating
powers. How much she felt the humiliation may be inferred
from her thinking it necessary to apologise to Sussex. While
sweetening the pill thus, she told him plainly that he had
failed, that his failure had been a direct encouragement to the
disaffected, and that he had confessed himself powerless to
carry matters with a high hand. Under the circumstances
there was nothing for it but to temporise. The mere form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
a submission was the best that could be looked for. Cusack
and Kildare accordingly met Shane, who descanted largely on
his losses, on the attempts made to assassinate him, and on
the persistent enmity of the Lord-Lieutenant towards him.
He was, however, brought to consent to a treaty, by which
he gained everything and yielded nothing. He was acknowledged
as O&#8217;Neill, with all the powers ever exercised under
that name. The Earldom of Tyrone was again dangled before
his eyes, but the Queen said that for her own honour she
could not go far into the matter until she had scrutinised the
patents. With characteristic frugality she asked about the
robes and collars sent to Sussex when he purposed to make
O&#8217;Reilly and O&#8217;Donnell Earls, so that they might be available
in case of a new creation. By the treaty concluded, Shane&#8217;s
differences with Maguire and O&#8217;Reilly were reserved for Commissioners,
but they were to have no power to enforce their
award. Chiefs who had committed the crime of loyalty were
abandoned, and Shane was released from all obligations to
appear in person before the Viceroy. His former promises to
the Queen were cancelled, and he was exonerated from all
responsibility for the murder of the Baron of Dungannon&#8217;s
son. Armagh Cathedral was to be restored to him, and he
agreed to use it as became the Metropolitan Church of Ireland.
Some trifling alterations were made in the treaty before ratification,
but the surrender on the Queen&#8217;s part was complete.
Sussex felt this bitterly, but put a good face on the matter,
and wrote to Shane in a conciliatory tone.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane

<p>Shane still professed much anxiety to live clearly after
the English fashion. An English wife was the best means to
that end, and of all eligible persons he preferred Lady Frances
Radclyffe. In this he had probably no other design than to
humiliate Sussex, but he suggested that the Queen should
give Mellifont as a dowry. If her Majesty would not make
a match, then he begged leave to seek a foreign alliance; but
he greatly preferred an English woman&mdash;Lady Frances above
all others&mdash;to increase his civil education, and to make his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
followers acknowledge their duties to the Queen. In any
case he was determined to be good in future, to be the
&#8216;plague of all rebels in those parts,&#8217; and to do all more cheaply
for his sovereign than she could do it for herself. Elizabeth
prudently answered that the question of an English wife
must be adjourned until Shane had proved his love of civilisation
by deeds as well as words.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt
to poison
Shane.</div>

<p>Just before the peace or truce an attempt had been made
to poison O&#8217;Neill in wine, of which he was accustomed to
drink a great deal. He and his servant suffered from the
dose; but no one died. It is not disputed that the guilty
man was John Smythe, who appears to have been a foot
soldier of Irish birth, one of a company in the Queen&#8217;s pay of
which Ormonde had the command. O&#8217;Neill demanded redress,
and the Queen, when she heard of the affair, wrote with
becoming indignation and horror. If there was any difficulty
about getting a fair trial in Ireland, the accused man was to
be sent to London. Elizabeth declared her willingness to
bear with much that was disorderly in Shane, and to trust
him more for the future on account of this great provocation.
Smythe was arrested and examined, but no punishment followed.
Whether Sussex or other great men were implicated,
or whether Ormonde wished to screen his man, will never now
be known, and Shane was induced to forgive Smythe. The
suave Cusack pointed out that he could not be hanged for a
mere attempt, and O&#8217;Neill despised any other punishment.
Cusack advised Cecil to let the thing blow over; and no
doubt this suited the Queen, who could not have forgotten
the Lord-Lieutenant&#8217;s plain-spoken letters in that other affair
of Neil Gray.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

Commission
on the
Pale, 1563.</div>

<p>Having pacified Ulster, or rather shut her eyes to its true
state, Elizabeth turned her attention to the state of the Pale.
The complaints of the Irish law students in London, of Parker,
of Bermingham, and of Shane O&#8217;Neill himself, had been partially
investigated by Arnold. Matthew King, Clerk of the
Check, was found to have been very remiss, and declared that
some of his gravest misdeeds had been done under direct
orders from the Lord-Lieutenant. Nothing could much exceed
the ill-feeling shown by Sussex to the party of inquiry, though
he did not actually obstruct Arnold, who, on his return to
London, made out a case too strong to be safely neglected.
Parker and Bermingham were consulted again, and Arnold
received a new commission. To make the investigation
thorough, all members of the Irish Council who had no men
in the Queen&#8217;s pay under them, and most of the principal
gentlemen of the Pale, were put into the Commission. Sir
Thomas Wrothe was associated with Arnold, and William
Dixe, a professional auditor, was afterwards joined to them.
Their instructions involved inquiry into almost all civil and
military, and into some ecclesiastical affairs. The Queen

and suggested a plan for a University in Dublin, to be endowed

<div class="sidenote">Cusack and
Desmond.</div>

<p>The indefatigable Cusack, whose great idea was the conciliation
of Ireland by arrangements with the native nobility,
was as anxious to obtain terms for Desmond as for Shane.
The Earl was tired of his detention in England, where he was
hard pressed for so moderate a sum as 4<i>l.</i> He agreed to be
responsible for order in Munster, to see that the Queen got
her feudal dues, and to pay her a tax of 4<i>d.</i> a year on every
cow. He promised to put down the Brehon law, as well as
the bards or rhymers who seem to have been thought still
more important; &#8216;for that they do by their ditties and rhymes
made to divers lords and gentlemen in Ireland, in the commendation
and high praise of extortion, rebellion, rape, raven,
and other injustice, encourage those lords and gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
rather to follow those vices than to leave them.&#8217; For every
shilling paid to these men, two were to be forfeited to the
Queen, whose Commissioners were to have power to fine the
rhymers at discretion.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
and
Ormonde.</div>

<p>It is probable that neither Cusack&#8217;s intercession nor
Desmond&#8217;s promises would have prevailed, had not the Earl&#8217;s
enforced absence left Munster in confusion. A dispute about
the title to Kilfeacle was one difficulty, and the legal question
cannot have been very hard to decide. But Desmond may
have distrusted the impartiality of lawyers rather than the
justice of his cause, and he preferred the old way of deciding
lawsuits. His brother John spoiled the Butlers, while
Ormonde, who was forbidden to retaliate, poured forth his
griefs to Sussex. With just pride he dilated upon the loyalty
of his ancestors, who had always been able to defend themselves,
and to take and keep the Desmond&#8217;s goods. His own
services were not small, but for fear of disobeying orders he
had to stand by, while he and his suffered more in two or
three years than his forefathers had in two centuries. Towns
were burned, women and children murdered, half Kilkenny
and Tipperary lay waste. &#8216;All this spoil, I assure your lordship,
doth not so much grieve me as that the Earl of Desmond
with his evil doings is like to speed as well as I that with my
service have deserved at least to be restored to my own.&#8217; In
trying to defend his property, Ormonde&#8217;s brother John had
been dangerously, if not mortally wounded. The Earl was
forced to see all this, and do nothing. &#8216;My lord, you see
what I get by sufferance; my brother left as dead, and mine
enemies living upon the spoil of my goods. My lord, who
shall render my brother his life if he die? Shall I live and
suffer all this? If I may not avenge my brother on these
disobedient Geraldines, as you are a just governor lend your
force against them, and let not my obedience be the cause
of my destruction.&#8217; He begged that in case of Desmond
being sent back to Ireland, he might at least be detained in
Dublin until restitution should be made, and the rebels delivered
to Sussex to be &#8216;justified.&#8217; Ormonde threw out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
significant hint that, failing this, he would leave his estate to
take care of itself, and go to the Queen, &#8216;like some other
private men.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond is
restored.</div>

<p>Desmond&#8217;s head was in the lion&#8217;s mouth, and he professed
loyalty, while doubting the capacity of the Munster chiefs for
civil life. If he was expected to do anything he must have
guns and gunners to take castles, and have the right to arrest
malefactors in the corporate towns. The Queen was silent
on these points, but urged Desmond to put down private
war, &#8216;which hurts the innocent, to the great displeasure of
Almighty God, and to our dishonour, whereof we pray you
to have due regard.&#8217; She ordered him to wait at Dublin for
Cusack, whose help he had himself asked. &#8216;The Queen&#8217;s
sword,&#8217; she said, &#8216;shall touch the guilty, and no other shall
be drawn.&#8217; Brave words! but much belied by facts.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties
of Wrothe
and Arnold.</div>

<p>The trouble which it cost Wrothe and Arnold to reach
Ireland pretty accurately foreshadowed the trouble which
awaited them there. After waiting a long time at Holyhead
they at last ventured to sea, but were taken aback before they
gained mid-Channel, and had to choose between scudding
under bare poles towards Ulster, or returning to Wales.
They chose the latter course, but failed to make the harbour.
They lay for a time under the shelter of some rocks, and were
glad to scramble ashore at three o&#8217;clock on a February morning,
wet and sick, but safe. Nine days later they were more
fortunate, and reached Dublin to find that Leix and Offaly
were again in rebellion, and that the financial confusion had
not been exaggerated. All captains, castellans, sheriffs, and
municipal officers were at once called on to produce accounts.
The inquiry into the musters was begun by demanding an
accurate return of all changes and vacancies in the Lord-Lieutenant&#8217;s
own company. Sussex said he was ready to
obey the Queen in all things, but that this had never been
required of any chief governor, and was, in fact, out of his
power. The debts to the Crown were great, and many of
them desperate. There was not one groat in the Treasury,
and the 11,000<i>l.</i> which the Commissioners brought was quite
inadequate. The Pale and the wild Irish were at daggers
drawn, for the former clung to their own customs and bye-laws,
and looked for the Queen&#8217;s protection in their attempts
at self-government. The Church was in no better case than
the State, but there was a pretty general wish to have St.
Patrick&#8217;s turned into a University. The Commissioners recommended
that the judges should put the Act of Uniformity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
generally in force, &#8216;not meddling with the simple multitude
now at the first, but with one or two boasting mass men in
every shire, that it may be seen that the punishment of such
men is meant.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wrothe&#8217;s
horror at
the general
corruption.</div>

<p>It soon became clear that Wrothe was not exactly the
fittest man for the work. He was anxious to do right, but
very nervous about exceeding the letter of his commission,
and from the first wishing to be recalled. He fell into a fever
which he felt certain would be attributed to riotous living, and
he assured Cecil that he seldom took more than one meal in
twenty-four hours, which was not the way to preserve health.
His sense of the general corruption made it hard for him to
gain friends, though he was generally praised for his willingness
to work hard. The whole rapacious pack of jobbers
longed to be rid of him, for he was bent on even-handed
justice, a scarce commodity, and not in demand with any
party. The Queen was considered fair game for every robber.
Arnold, a man cast in a much rougher mould, had little
regard for his colleague&#8217;s feelings, and a coolness soon sprung
up between them. On Sussex obtaining sick leave, the
general government was entrusted to Arnold, and the new
Lord Justice expected Wrothe to do the business of the
Commission single-handed. He was willing enough to take
routine work on himself, but declined to be responsible for
any matter of moment unless Arnold was joined with him in
it. &#8216;God deal with me,&#8217; he wrote, &#8216;as I have meant to serve
the Queen here. My mind is troubled and my conscience,
for God&#8217;s sake help me.... Our bowls here be so much
biassed, and I have no skill but with upright bowls, and
therefore unfit for this alley.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Great
abuses.</div>

<p>After a partial examination of the public accounts, Auditor
Dixe estimated that the Queen&#8217;s debts were between 30,000<i>l.</i>
and 40,000<i>l.</i> The victualler and the officers engaged on
fortifications gave in their accounts, but they were full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
mistakes. The cessors of the Pale, who were very numerous
and often very incompetent, were slow to produce their books.
Captains of companies delivered muster-rolls from May 1560,
when they had been fully paid off by the Lord-Lieutenant&#8217;s
warrant, but declined to do so for the previous year on the
ground that it was contrary to custom. In many cases the
books were not forthcoming, but this was not unnatural in
the case of officers who constantly changed their quarters,
and who did not expect any further question to arise. The
real fault was in the Government. We are accustomed to
clock-work regularity, and can scarcely imagine the loose way
in which things were done even much later than Elizabeth&#8217;s
days. When Lord Shelburne joined Colonel Wolfe&#8217;s regiment,
the future hero of Quebec told him that he must not
draw his pay, but let it accumulate for the benefit of deserving
officers. But it was not only in money accounts that
Wrothe and Arnold found the army in Ireland defective.
There was an old order that every captain should find pay for
his Irish soldiers if he thought proper to have more than five in
his company. As a matter of fact many companies were half
Irish, and this had long been winked at. The captains were
now told that the Queen wanted no Irish soldiers. Wild
Irishmen could not be trusted, and tame Irishmen were necessarily
a deduction from the strength of the Pale. It was
not for the Queen&#8217;s interest that the rebels should know all
the secrets of the service and all the art of war. Irish
soldiers would take less pay than Englishmen, and it was
therefore for the private interest of officers to enlist them.
The captains pleaded the Lord-Lieutenant&#8217;s orders to make
up their strength. Englishmen could not be had, and they
threw themselves on the Queen&#8217;s mercy; they were ready to
serve her while life lasted.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Harsh proceedings
of
Arnold.</div>

<p>But Bermingham, who was Arnold&#8217;s principal adviser, understood
the duties of the Commission differently. According
to his view every officer, from the Lord-Lieutenant downwards,
was to be visited with extreme penalties for every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
technical error. No allowance was to be made for men who
were irregularly and not highly paid, and who had too often
to make her Majesty&#8217;s bricks without straw. It was hard in
Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s time&mdash;it is hard enough in Queen Victoria&#8217;s&mdash;to
apportion the blame between the English Government
and its servants in Ireland, but the irregularities themselves
were scandalous enough. Even Bermingham had some
doubts about the policy of employing anyone living in
Ireland to inquire into matters personally affecting the
Queen&#8217;s representative, but the Commissioners were peremptory,
and he had to deliver a book of exceptions to the Lord-Lieutenant&#8217;s
muster. A roll of his own, accompanying this
document, contained 213 names, but of these twenty-five
were holders of other offices, thirty were occasionally employed
by other captains, and sixty-four were of Irish birth,
though by rights all but eight should have been Englishmen.
Of the Englishmen born ten were no soldiers, but at best
retainers. A soldier&#8217;s pay was drawn in the name of the
clerk of Christ Church, and still more strangely in the name
of Adam Loftus, &#8216;primate and bishop of Armagh, almost these
two years.&#8217; Sussex could muster 155 men, but no more than
forty-three were really fit for service, and of these twenty-eight
were officers. Thomas Smythe, the apothecary, who
probably kept drugs for poisoning as well as for healing, was
borne on the strength, and so were butchers, carters, woodcutters,
scullions, makers of arras, musicians, a mariner, an
old fisherman, a blind man, and a dead man. Brian Fitzwilliam&#8217;s
company should have mustered 200, exclusive of
officers, whereas the rank and file in reality only numbered
128. Captain Fortescue&#8217;s followers were found to be nearly
all Irish; they were disbanded, and as Fortescue declined to
account, he was committed to prison.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wrothe is

Irregularities

Proceedings
against
the officers.</div>

<p>When the Commission had been at work for a year, Elizabeth
found out that it was very slow and very expensive. She
recalled Wrothe, much to his own delight, but to the despair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of Dixe, who was left single-handed to cope with Arnold and
Bermingham. Unrestrained by an English colleague, the
Lord Justice now proceeded to extremities, a course in which
he was encouraged by the local magnates joined with him in
the Commission. The captains were required to enter into
recognizances, binding themselves under penalties to give a
detailed account of all they had received, and to make good
deficiencies. The captains were willing to bind themselves
to account for all the money or value which they could be
proved to have received, and confessed that they had been
negligent about the preservation of books, but refused to admit
the evidence of private soldiers instead of documentary proofs.
Any one who has had anything to do with paying troops will
know that they were amply justified in the refusal. The
Commissioners proceeded in the most arbitrary way, refusing
to make any allowance for men employed as servants, and
proposing to pay all according to the roll, and without the
knowledge of the captains. All Irishmen above six in each
company were to be peremptorily disallowed, without considering
the explanations offered on this head. The Commissioners
swore in twelve soldiers from each company, and encouraged
them to say all they could against their captains; and
having thus collected much hostile evidence, they refused
copies to the officers concerned. Captain George Delves
having declined to submit to the requirements of the Commissioners,
though he offered to give all reasonable security, was
sent to prison. Sir Henry Radclyffe, the Lord-Lieutenant&#8217;s
brother, and Sir George Stanley, the Marshal, &#8216;seeing their
staves to stand next the door,&#8217; as they themselves expressed
it, protested strongly against the &#8216;opening of matters, we do
not say the forging of matters,&#8217; to their prejudice. They significantly
added that all the Commissioners were blood-relations
to each other and to Bermingham. Auditor Dixe, who
seems to have been really anxious to do right, heard the Lord
Justice talk much of the &#8216;exactions, impositions, cessings,

nobility, who extorted twice as much. The auditor reminded
Cecil that he was but one man against fourteen. The jobbing
of family parties, as they have been called, has indeed been
for centuries one of the chief difficulties of ministers who have
been successively charged with the government of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arnold is

zealous.
Sir Henry
Radclyffe&#8217;s
case.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Arnold
imprisons
the Lord-Lieutenant&#8217;s
brother</div>

<p>Sir Henry Radclyffe, the most highly placed and best connected
officer in Ireland, was summoned before Arnold to give
fuller answers to Bermingham&#8217;s charges. He refused to go
back to a period before the last general payment, but offered
to wait on the Commission at any time after one hour&#8217;s notice,
and begged that his soldiers might not be paid in his absence.
Well might Radclyffe exclaim, &#8216;fiat justitia,&#8217; when this common
measure of justice was denied to him. Dixe was ordered to
settle with Sir Henry&#8217;s company according to their own report.
He obeyed; but took the precaution to have some of the Commissioners
present, and declined to be bound by the results
of such a monstrous order. It was hardly worth while to
brand the character of the Queen&#8217;s officers, and to destroy the
discipline of her troops for the sake of 10<i>l.</i>, saved in the
payment of a company of fifty. Radclyffe asked for a passport,
and even offered to be tried by his own soldiers. Both
requests were refused, and the Commissioners, who seem to
have surrendered themselves to Bermingham&#8217;s guidance, declared
that if fraud appeared on the face of the incriminating
document drawn up by him, they would force Radclyffe to
give the details which he had already refused. He was made
to appear about 6,000<i>l.</i> in debt, nearly half of which was
on account of Irishmen enlisted above the number officially
allowed. The accused officer was then committed to prison,
and Arnold, having undertaken to see his men paid, refused
to settle the tradesmen&#8217;s bills for necessaries, alleging that all
should fall on the captains. There may have been great
negligence, but the Lord Justice did not venture to accuse
Radclyffe of any false statement; and it must be admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
that, whatever his faults, he had managed to keep Leix and
Offaly quiet. As much could not be said for Arnold, whom
the English Council gently rebuked for taking such an extreme
course with an officer of high rank, a Privy Councillor, and a
man of family. There could be no objection to detaining him
in Ireland if necessary, but he might have been left at liberty.
Cecil and Leicester, after privately examining the voluminous
and contradictory reports, declared themselves puzzled in some
things, and advised Arnold to take a good many of the Irish
Council into his confidence. They reminded him that Dixe,
with whom he appeared unable to agree, was chosen for a
man of honesty and ability. What Leicester and Cecil could
not fully understand at the time, we shall hardly be able to
clear up now. That Radclyffe had committed irregularities
was not denied, that they were much smaller both in amount
and in kind than Arnold supposed may be gathered from the
fact that he was afterwards allowed to give a bond for 600<i>l.</i>
to repay all moneys overpaid to him, if the balance should be
against him at a final closing. Sir George Stanley gave a
similar bond for 300<i>l.</i> Nicholas Heron, another captain
whom Arnold treated with great rigour, was afterwards
knighted, and died in the enjoyment of the Queen&#8217;s favour.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">&#8216;Sir
Thomas
Cusack&#8217;s
peaces.&#8217;
Shane in
his glory.</div>

<p>While Arnold was occupied in exposing, and perhaps exaggerating
the defects of military administration, the optimist
Cusack was trying to keep Shane O&#8217;Neill in good humour.
&#8216;Sir Thomas Cusack&#8217;s peaces&#8217; became a byword in official
circles. The last was made on the basis of leaving Shane all
the glories of the O&#8217;Neills until the Queen gave him his father&#8217;s
title. He was not to be brought before the chief governor
against his will, and the disputes between English and Irish
in the North were to be referred to arbitration. The Queen
had made up her mind to brook the fact of a great O&#8217;Neill;
but she positively refused to confirm the articles exempting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
him from attending on the Viceroy, and referring all to arbitration.
Shane then declared that he would have all or none;
but he signed a temporary agreement for the pacification
of the borders, and he appears to have kept it for a time.
Cusack, who was never tired of singing Shane&#8217;s praises, wished
to have the Great Seal affixed to the original treaty; but the
Privy Council dared not mention it to Elizabeth, the alterations
being deemed necessary for her honour. That saved, there
was every desire to humour the tyrant of the North. Elizabeth
said she thought she had yielded enough, but was willing to
have Shane&#8217;s disputes with the Baron of Dungannon&#8217;s sons
decided in the next Irish Parliament. Shane dared to claim
Lady Frances Radclyffe as having been &#8216;appointed to him by
the Queen&#8217;s Majesty,&#8217; and the Privy Council were afraid to
say more than that the question must be left till Sussex
reached the Court. How Lady Frances would have fared as
Shane&#8217;s wife may be inferred from the way in which he treated
his mistress. The Countess of Argyle, the accomplished lady
who had left her husband for his sake, was chained by day
to a little boy, and only released when wanted to amuse her
master&#8217;s drunken leisure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane&#8217;s
offers of
service.</div>

<p>Lord Robert Dudley, mindful of their old sport together,
advised the chieftain to do some notable service, and thus
deserve the royal favour. He answered that the Scots were
rebels and traitors, who usurped the Queen&#8217;s lands and revenues
in the North, and that he would drive them all out of
Ireland for no greater reward than the pay of forty men. In
other words, he would gladly have had the Queen&#8217;s help in
adding the MacDonnell lands to his own.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ill-treatment
and
torture of
O&#8217;Donnell.</div>

<p>Cusack&#8217;s anxiety to please Shane was so great that he
had no feeling left for O&#8217;Donnell, whose fate might well have
moved the hardest heart. Seven years before, he told the
Queen, O&#8217;Neill when hard pressed by the Government had
been glad enough to take refuge in Tyrconnel, to marry his
daughter, to profess loyalty to the Queen, and to swear eternal
friendship to his hospitable host. O&#8217;Donnell had been glad
to hear his son-in-law talk so, and said that he would befriend
him only as long as he was loyal. Then Shane had taken to
intriguing with his clansmen, and probably, if we may judge by
the sequel, with his father-in-law&#8217;s wife. After his treacherous
capture O&#8217;Donnell was bound hand and foot, an iron collar
round his neck being tightly chained to the gyves on his
ankles. Night or day he could neither lie down nor stand up.
&#8216;When he perceived,&#8217; said the victim, &#8216;that I could not be
undone after this manner, he thought to torment me after
another manner, to the intent that he might have all my
jewels, and so he caused the irons to be strained upon my
legs and upon my hands so sore that the very blood ran down
on every side of mine irons, insomuch that I did wish after
death one thousand times.&#8217; No Christian or Turk, he thought,
had ever been treated worse, and besides his personal wrongs
not less than 500 people of some condition, and at least
14,000 of the poor, had lost their lives through O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s
cruelty. His son Con, whose cousins delivered him to Shane,
had been induced by torture to promise the surrender of
Lifford. The tribesmen refused to give it up, and Shane
threatened to strike off his prisoner&#8217;s leg. While Con daily
expected death, his tormentor blockaded Lifford with earthworks,
and his cattle ate down the green corn for miles round.
The castle was taken, and all Tyrconnel was then at Shane&#8217;s
mercy.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Release of
O&#8217;Donnell.
He goes to
Dublin, where he
gets scant
comfort,
and thence
to England,
where</div>

<p>O&#8217;Donnell himself was released after a captivity of two
years and nine months, partly perhaps because he had been
a troublesome prisoner. According to Cusack, or rather to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Shane, who was his informant, he had given up Lifford, promised
many kine and much plate and jewels, and released his
ancient claim to the suzerainty of Innishowen. In the absence
of documentary evidence no one is bound to believe this, and
in any case, promises extracted by torture could hardly be
thought binding. O&#8217;Donnell was indeed in no condition to
pay such a ransom, for he had lost all control over his country.
He had incurred unpopularity by paying a pension to Argyle
as the price of his faithless wife. O&#8217;Neill had, however,
seized Con in revenge for the alleged breach of contract.
&#8216;Con,&#8217; said Sir Thomas Wrothe, &#8216;is as wise and active an
Irishman as any in Ireland:&#8217; he was married to an O&#8217;Neill,
and there was a suspicion that the lady favoured her father
rather than her husband. Cusack advised Arnold to give
O&#8217;Donnell nothing but fair words, and a letter to Shane
bidding him use his prisoner well. On reaching Dublin
O&#8217;Donnell was accordingly received with outward marks of
respect, but Arnold refused to give him any help or to allow
him to go to England. He was reminded that his grandfather,
who was &#8216;the honestest O&#8217;Donnell that ever was,&#8217; never came
to the governor but to ask aid when banished by his son, and
that son was in turn banished by his son the present suppliant.
Calvagh was told that he came not now for service
but for help, for which he would go to the Turk, and that no
O&#8217;Donnell ever did come for service, nor was able to hurt the
Pale, except when allied with O&#8217;Neill, Maguire, Magennis,
O&#8217;Rourke, and O&#8217;Reilly. The family quarrels of the O&#8217;Donnells
could not be denied, but they might at least be matched
by those of the O&#8217;Neills, and there was something savouring
strongly of meanness in the rest of the answer, when we
reflect that Calvagh had been in alliance with the English
Government at the time of his misfortune. The cause had
been determined against him beforehand, but he came before
the Lord Justice and Council to hear his statement read, and
to add what might be required by word of mouth. &#8216;Hearing
his bill read,&#8217; says Wrothe, &#8216;he burst out into such a weeping
as when he should speak he could not, but was fain by his
interpreter to pray license to weep, and so went his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
without saying anything. Sure it pitied me to see him, and
more because his present help is doubtful, for although it may
be said that the wisest to win peace will take war in hand,
and that it is likely Shane will not be reformed but by war,&#8217;
yet the poverty of Ireland and the occupation of England
made war well-nigh impracticable.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">the Queen
receives
him kindly,
but he fears
Arnold, and
withdraws
to Scotland.</div>

<p>Arnold seems to have thought himself bound to do in
all things exactly the opposite of Sussex, and he accepted
Cusack&#8217;s rose-coloured view of Shane&#8217;s intentions. But
Wrothe&#8217;s reasoning was more dispassionate. He saw the
danger of letting O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s country come under the power
of O&#8217;Neill, who gave good words but went his own way
nevertheless. If possible he was to be pacified, but war
might prove inevitable, and to be successful it would have
to be conducted in a new way. He saw that O&#8217;Donnell was
determined to go to the Queen with or without license, and
if necessary by way of Scotland. The Queen said she would
willingly see O&#8217;Donnell at Court if it would do him any good,
but that the causes between him and Shane would have to be
tried in Ireland, and she did not see what he could gain by
the journey. She saw Arnold&#8217;s bias clearly enough, and said
plainly that the Dean and Chapter of Armagh, who had been
named, were no fit Commissioners to judge of this matter.
Terence Daniel and his colleague had a too natural affection
towards O&#8217;Neill. As Wrothe had foreseen, O&#8217;Donnell, who
feared that chains and torture awaited him in Ulster, would
not be denied, but took the first opportunity of slipping over
to England during Arnold&#8217;s temporary absence, and he made
his appearance at Court, where he told his griefs to the Queen,
and to Leicester, Winchester, and Cecil. Elizabeth evidently
felt much for the unfortunate chief, gave him money, and sent
him back to Ireland, directing Arnold to make him some
allowance until his causes were decided. &#8216;We are not,&#8217; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
said, &#8216;without compassion for him in this calamity, specially
considering his first entry thereto was by taking part against
Shane when he made war against our good subjects there.&#8217;
No one was ever able to resist Elizabeth when she spoke
graciously, but O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s experience of Arnold had not
been satisfactory, and he thought it prudent to withdraw for
a time to the Scottish Court, where he was sure of sympathy
from the relations of his foolish and guilty wife, the daily
victim of Shane&#8217;s brutality.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane
attacks the
Scots.</div>

<p>His hereditary enemies having been reduced to a harmless
state, Shane proceeded, with the full approval of the Government,
to attack the Scots, who prevented him from doing as
he pleased in the North. But Arnold was not so completely
blinded by his professions as to make him free of Carrickfergus,
which he claimed as of ancient right. Neither was it
thought convenient to withdraw Kildare from the defence of
the Pale, as Shane urgently desired. Eight or nine hundred
Scots, under the command of Sorley Boy, lay near the left
bank of the Bann, opposite Coleraine, where Shane had made
the old castle tenable. His object being to get complete
command of the estuary, he sent over a small party in the
country boats or &#8216;cots,&#8217; which were his only means of transport,
and having posted them strongly in the Dominican
Friary, withdrew to his main body. The Scots attacked the
outpost like madmen, as Dean Danyell expressed it, and lost
many men, but succeeded in killing all the defenders except
the mounted men, who were seized with a panic and swam
their horses over the flooded river. Neither party had much
to boast, but Shane could point to the affair as a test of his
sincerity. He bragged about what he would do next time,
when there might be no flood, and he again suggested that
he might be allowed to make Carrickfergus his base until
preparations for renewing the war were complete. Arnold
yielded so far as to sanction his entry with some of his chief
followers. Captain Piers was to show the formidable visitor
every civility, but for sparing of the poor town was to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the multitude of his company as far off as possible. Shane&#8217;s
views changed, or the policy of Piers was successful in keeping
him at arm&#8217;s length, but he plundered the town of Carlingford
before doing any further service against the Scots, burned
the country all about, and ravished the women far and wide,
up to the walls of Dundalk. More damage has been done,
said Fitzwilliam, &#8216;than seven years of such profit as is from
Shane.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nothing so
dangerous
as loyalty.
Calvagh
O&#8217;Connor.</div>

<p>When Sussex left Ireland Leix and Offaly were pretty
quiet, but his departure had been the signal for disturbance.
Arnold was accused of oppressing the remnant of the O&#8217;Connors,
and by his own account he cared little for peace.
Ormonde&#8217;s brother persecuted the O&#8217;Mores, who were reduced
to a state not much above brigandage. He killed a dozen
kerne near Castle-comer, and apologised for not doing more:
&#8216;if we had any ground for horsemen we should have made a
fair haul.&#8217; Arnold praised Sir Edmund&#8217;s activity, but looked
forward to general disorder as soon as the long nights, which
are still dreaded in Ireland, should give better opportunities
to the disaffected. By way of precaution he imprisoned
Calvagh O&#8217;Connor, as some said, with little or no cause,
but, as Arnold maintained, for intriguing with tribes on
both sides the Shannon, and for engaging Scots mercenaries.
Yet there is good ground for believing that this poor
O&#8217;Connor tried to be a loyal subject, with the result of being
mistrusted by both parties. &#8216;When I was a rebel,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;I had friends enough, but now I serve the Queen&#8217;s Majesty
I am daily in fear of my life.&#8217; Unable to get a hearing,
Calvagh, though heavily ironed, managed to break prison,
and having been treated as a rebel became one in earnest.
Great preparations were made on the borders of the Pale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Arnold demanded help from all the Irish clans in the central
parts of the island. The Earl of Kildare was ordered to
assemble his people, and letters were sent to the gentlemen
of the Pale and to the settlers in the King&#8217;s and Queen&#8217;s
counties. Wexford and Carlow were not forgotten, and
Ormonde, who received a special commission and pay for 200
kerne for three months, was directed to watch the rebels, who
were proclaimed by name, and to attack them if they came
near his border. These tremendous preparations for the hunt,
for it was little more, were crowned with such success as was
possible. Calvagh O&#8217;Connor was killed by a near kinsman,
and his head presented to the Lord Justice. Sir Barnaby
Fitzpatrick, Edward VI.&#8217;s old companion, dutifully attacked
the O&#8217;Mores. But Sir Barnaby himself was little better off
than an outlaw, for his father, the first Baron of Upper Ossory,
had but imperfectly laid aside Celtic usages when he accepted
an Anglo-Norman title; and under the influence of a wicked
second wife, he persecuted his loyal and civilised heir. The
O&#8217;Connors were dispersed into little parties of eight or ten,
who lived as best they might in the bogs. The O&#8217;Mores had
wider contiguous wastes, and managed to keep better together,
but they were glad to sue for peace. It was an inglorious
campaign, which only served to show how completely the
settlement of the country had failed to reconcile the native
population.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond,
Thomond,
and Clanricarde.</div>

<p>After his return from England, Desmond kept quiet for a
time. The indefatigable Cusack visited Waterford for the
purpose of settling his dispute with Ormonde, but had to leave
his work unfinished so as to proceed with the more pressing
business of O&#8217;Neill. But Desmond&#8217;s men were not idle, for
they were allowed to interfere in the affairs of Thomond,
taking part with Sir Donnell the tanist against the Earl.
The help of Clanricarde, whose interests inclined him to the
side of the latter, alone prevented him from being driven out
of the country. Clanricarde expressly says that Desmond
himself crossed the Shannon, and set on him by surprise,
killing 30 men, and taking 800 cows, which helped to pay
the intruder&#8217;s gallowglasses. They were indeed well paid, for
they received more than half the cattle of Thomond. There
was some talk of giving Clanricarde cannon to take the castle
of Inchiquin, and Desmond was straightly charged by Arnold
to abstain from further interference. Royal Commissioners, of
whom Parker was one, visited Cork, and the gentlemen of the
county appeared, offering to hold their lands by knight service,
and to give security for good behaviour. Desmond described
the proceedings in glowing language, but did not recall his
gallowglasses from Thomond, whence the Earl continued to
beg earnestly for help. Ormonde was directed to give such
help as he could spare from pursuing the O&#8217;Mores, and Cusack,
the general pacificator, again made his way to the South,
when it was agreed that Manus Oge O&#8217;Sheehy, with his 400
gallowglasses and 200 musketeers and horsemen, should be
withdrawn, and that those who ferried them over Shannon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
should be punished. Differences were to be settled by arbitration,
and all were to live happily ever after. Thus, to
borrow the contemptuous language of Sir George Stanley,
&#8216;did Sir Thomas Cusack conclude according to his accustomed
manner a fyckelede peace.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ormonde
resolves to
put down
coyne and
livery.</div>

<p>Ormonde had been brought up in England. He was a
personal favourite with the Queen, and there can be no doubt
that he was sincerely anxious to live the life of a civilised
nobleman rather than that of a barbarous chief. Money rents,
which he might spend at Court or at home in building such
houses as Carrick, had a greater attraction for him than the
ancient habit of eating up the country with turbulent soldiers
and useless horse-boys, three or four to every horse. Perhaps
too he longed to boast that, while an Earl of Desmond had
been the first to bring in the curse of coyne and livery upon
Ireland, an Earl of Ormonde had been the first to take it away.
He accordingly issued a proclamation which throws much
light on the state of the country. Reciting his right to regal
power and jurisdiction in Tipperary, he confessed his obligation
to see it properly governed. War and disorder had
hitherto forced him and his ancestors to exact coyne and
livery, necessarily showing a bad example to others who had
not the excuse of responsibility. He spoke of &#8216;the poverty,
misery, and calamity whereunto the poor subjects be brought
by the licentious multitude of Irish rascals which be bred and
maintained by the said coyne and livery.&#8217; The Earl&#8217;s officers
could not do their duty, the Queen was defrauded of her
revenue, and it was therefore agreed &#8216;by the consent and
assent of all the lords and gentlemen of the same county, that
no coyne or livery or Irish exactions should be thenceforth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
levied.&#8217; This extended to the possessions of all the Butlers,
of the Prendergasts, and of the Archbishop of Cashel, north of
the Suir, and within the bounds of Tipperary. Proclamation
was to be made in all market towns that severe penalties
would be incurred by levying the said exactions after August 1,
every one being licensed to resist by force. But there was
danger lest this godly victory over the horrible and devouring
monster should leave the country defenceless, and therefore a
quarterly muster of the able-bodied people was to be taken.
Every landowner was to furnish a certain fixed quota of horses,
harness, and men ready for any sudden emergency. It was
hoped that the towns would then increase, and that their inhabitants
would supply no mean force. In case it was absolutely
necessary to bring strangers into the county, they were
to be regularly waged, the Earl being authorised by the freeholders
to exact a fixed sum of money for the purpose. Every
strange soldier was to pay for all he had at the rate of 2<i>d.</i> a
meal for himself and 1<i>d.</i> for his boy, and similar payments
were to be made when it became necessary to move the local
militia. The lords and gentlemen of Tipperary subscribed
this treaty.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His reforms
interrupted
by threats
from
Desmond.</div>

<p>Ormonde, however, was not able for this time to carry out
his good intentions. Desmond attacked his tenants, and he
was forced to &#8216;continue one disorder to withstand another.&#8217;
The cheerful views of Cusack, who believed that he had really
pacified Munster in a manner redounding to his own and the
Queen&#8217;s honour, were soon woefully belied. The real pacificator
had been Lady Desmond, and her death at this juncture
removed the last restraint from her husband, and cured her
son of his last compunction. Sir Maurice Fitzgerald of the
Decies, who lived at Dromana on the Blackwater, and who was
descended from the second son of the seventh Earl, possessed
part of the original Desmond estate, which he claimed to hold
of the Crown by feudal tenure. But Desmond preferred to
regard him as a subordinate Irish chief, liable to the payment
of various Irish dues and exactions. Sir Maurice, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Ormonde&#8217;s first cousin, appealed to him for protection against
distraint, and requested him to take charge of his cattle until
the storm had blown over. Desmond alleged that distress
had been taken time out of mind in the Decies, but Ormonde
held that it was part of the county of Waterford, and that all
such pretensions were therefore void in law. Having also
good reason to believe that an attack upon Tipperary was
meditated, Ormonde led a force to Clonmel, and encamped at
Knocklofty, near the foot of the mountain pass leading into
Sir Maurice&#8217;s country. In due course came a special messenger
to say that Desmond was already on his way, and
Ormonde lost no time in obeying the summons. With 100
horse and 300 or 400 foot, and accompanied by his brothers
Edmund, James, and Edward, he hastened across the mountains,
and found that Desmond was already collecting rents
in the familiar fashion of his House.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
attacks the
Decies.
Ormonde
goes to the
rescue.</div>

<p>From the preparations made, it can hardly be supposed
that the Geraldine chief had no design beyond the avowed
one of making Sir Maurice pay his dues. Some of the
O&#8217;Connors, proclaimed traitors, were with him, and he went
to Clare to summon those O&#8217;Briens who were in the same
case. The White Knight came to Lismore with an armed
party, and the Knight of Kerry, with MacCarthy More, and
O&#8217;Sullivan Beare were reported to have come as far as Conna.
The Earl himself was accompanied by his brother Thomas, by
John FitzEdmund, seneschal of Imokilly, a valiant man, who
afterwards gave much trouble, and by the White Knight&#8217;s
eldest son. His force consisted of 80 or 100 horse, 300 or
400 foot, and several hundred of the mixed camp followers and
plunderers, comprehensively described as &#8216;rascally.&#8217; Desmond
was intriguing among such of the Butlers as were inclined to
oppose the head of their House. Sir Piers Butler, of Cahir,
who complained that he was oppressed by Ormonde, was with
the White Knight at Lismore, and Desmond, though his wife
was only just buried, already sought the hand of Lord Dun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>boyne&#8217;s
daughter. The marriage eventually took place, and
was not destined to bring good fortune to the Geraldines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude of
Desmond.</div>

<p>Desmond left Lismore with the first light of a winter&#8217;s
morning, and marched to a place called Bewley, where there
is now a bridge over the Finisk, near the highest point to
which the tide comes. He sent Lord Power and one of his
captains to demand Irish service from Sir Maurice, who rode
with them towards Desmond, and offered to abide by the order
of the Lord Justice and Council, or by the award of four
lawyers, two to be chosen by either side. He professed himself
willing to do as his ancestors had done. Desmond insisted
that all should be left to the decision of &#8216;his own judge,&#8217;
probably a Brehon, and in any case a partial person. He prepared
to encamp in the neighbourhood, killed sixty head of
cattle, and sent to Dungarvan for wine. Sir Maurice rode
back, without having met the Earl, and saw three houses on
fire, one of them being that in which the invader had rested
during the forenoon. Sir Maurice and two of his men then
went to watch his progress from a neighbouring hill, whence
they espied Ormonde and his men coming down the opposite
mountain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fight
at Affane.
Desmond
is taken
prisoner.</div>

<p>The Butlers rested on the hill side. Their horses were
scattered about at grass, and a countryman galloped off to
Desmond, offering himself as guide, and advising an immediate
attack. Desmond inquired eagerly whether my Lord
of Ormonde were there himself, and on receiving an incorrect
answer in the negative, exclaimed, &#8216;Let us go upon them, for
they are but young boys, and rascally, and we shall take them
grazing their horses.&#8217; Lord Power advised him not to meddle
with the Butlers, who were perhaps in superior force, but to
retire to his house at Curraghmore, where they could not
harm him. Desmond&#8217;s road to Youghal was also open, but
he preferred the middle course of returning to Lismore, where
his auxiliaries were, with whose help he might hope clearly
to outnumber the Ormondians, who refreshed themselves, and
continued the even tenor of their way southwards to the ford
at Affane. The Geraldine foot went on in advance, and no
collision seems to have been at first intended, for they passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Ormonde&#8217;s main body at the cross roads; but as soon as their
leader saw his hated rival, he put spurs to his horse like Cyrus
at Cunaxa, and some of his men discharged their pieces.
Ormonde seems to have been still unwilling to fight, for he
allowed the hostile foot to recross him. Being actually charged,
the Butlers stood on their defence, and soon proved the wisdom
of Lord Power&#8217;s advice, for Sir Edmund Butler broke Desmond&#8217;s
thigh with a pistol shot, and some 300 of his men fell.
Desmond afterwards said that many of his people tried to
escape by swimming the Blackwater, where they were intercepted
by armed boats; and he offered this as a proof that
the fight resulted from a plot hatched between Ormonde and
Sir Maurice. But this was strenuously denied. The wounded
Earl was carried to Clonmel, and thence to Waterford, and
his adherents withdrew to their own homes.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ormonde

<p>The battle or skirmish at Affane seems to have been the
last on English or Irish ground in which two noblemen without
any commission made private war upon each other. Sir
Maurice Fitzgerald says that banners were displayed on Desmond&#8217;s
side, and that Ormonde &#8216;staying still at the beginning
of the conflict, did suddenly put up a thing of red silk upon a
staff.&#8217; It was probably intended as a rallying point for his men,
but Ormonde himself denied that a flag had been displayed.
The Queen had declared that no sword but hers should be
drawn, and angrily summoned the two Earls to her presence.
Both letters are guarded in expression, but that to Desmond is
rather the more severe of the two. With the consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
which she often showed to old and tried servants, she wrote
very graciously to Cusack, the failure of whose policy was now
apparent to all. &#8216;He had done his best,&#8217; she said, &#8216;but the
enmity between the two Earls was greater and deeplier rooted
than could be reformed by any but her own princely directions.&#8217;
Arnold came to Waterford soon after the arrival of Ormonde
and his prisoner, and interrogatories were administered to the
persons principally concerned. To do the legal business, the
Lord Justice took with him Mr. Justice Plunkett, who was
married to Kildare&#8217;s daughter, and thus, in the language of
the country, &#8216;ajainte and follower to the garontynes.&#8217; Sir
George Stanley, Marshal of the Army, who had no reason to
love Arnold, declared that it was as much as he could do to
prevent the Lord Justice from prejudging the case in a sense
unfavourable to Ormonde. Arnold began by demanding the
custody of the prisoner, as no doubt he had a right to do; but
he did it in such a way as to make it appear a slight to the
captor, who demanded an order in writing. At last he was
promised a copy of the entry in the Council Book, and he
then brought Desmond himself. &#8216;My Lord Justice,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;hither have I brought to you my Lord of Desmond, according
to your straight commandment given me, which in no way I
meant to disobey. And I deliver him unto you as the Queen&#8217;s
Majesty&#8217;s prisoner, being taken in the field by me with his
banner displayed, burning and spoiling the Queen&#8217;s Majesty&#8217;s
good subjects within shire ground, with sundry traitors in his
company.&#8217; He then charged him with high treason, and earnestly
besought that he might be kept securely, and not
allowed to communicate with anyone till the Queen&#8217;s pleasure
should be known. &#8216;And seeing,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;you have
thus taken him from me, if men&#8217;s mouths be stopped, as I
fear they will, and by means thereof some part of his heinous
treason come not to light, I trust therein I shall be discharged
to her Majesty.&#8217; The policy of isolating Desmond had indeed
been approved at the Council table, but Arnold nevertheless
allowed all men free access to him. The Council were inclined
to have the interrogatories administered to the two
Earls answered by counsel, but Stanley refused to agree to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
on the technical ground that Desmond was accused of treason.
In law he was right, but morally wrong, and had Arnold dealt
the same measure to both sides, little could have been said
against him. But Ormonde was required to answer at once
in his own person, while Desmond was allowed several days,
during which he had answers drawn in writing by a lawyer.
Stanley again objecting, the Lord Justice told him that he
was a wilful man, and affectioned to my Lord of Ormonde.
But Vice-Treasurer Fitzwilliam, who had some experience
of Desmond and his doings, took exactly the same view as
Stanley. &#8216;So good an offer given of God, and so overthrown,
I will not judge too far, hath not lightly been seen, but
20,000<i>l.</i> will not buy out that which (if he had been honourably
kept, so it had been with restraint from common speech)
might have been had.&#8217; Arnold stayed seven weeks at Waterford
without much furthering the business, and Ormonde soon
went to England. Desmond, accompanied by MacCarthy
More and O&#8217;Sullivan Beare, was sent over in the custody of
Captain Heron, who records that his distinguished prisoner
was very sea-sick. Arnold borrowed 200 marks to defray expenses,
but Heron, writing from Liverpool for orders, complained
that he was not furnished with money. The Earl&#8217;s
long halt at Chester may have been caused less by sickness
and fatigue than by a wish to hear the last news from Ireland.
The Queen wrote strongly to Lords Roche, Barrymore,
Power, and Dunboyne, urging them to maintain order during
Desmond&#8217;s absence, and the amiable Cusack doubtless felt
that under his skilful management all would still go merry
as a marriage bell.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane
O&#8217;Neill
attacks the
Scots,</div>

<p>After his exploit at Carlingford, Shane O&#8217;Neill lay quiet
for a long time, watching the Scots, to whom he had lately
done much damage. These hardy warriors were over confident.
They neither took the trouble to negotiate with Shane,
nor abstained from saying that Englishmen had no right
to Ireland; boasting that they had already 70 miles out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the 120 between Coleraine and Dublin, and that they would
soon have the rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and gains
a complete
victory.</div>

<p>After Easter Shane quietly collected a strong force at
Edenduff Carrick, or Shane&#8217;s Castle, and having cut passes to
secure a retreat, marched rapidly by Broughshane and Clogh
to the North. The warning fires went up from the hills about
Fair Head, and James MacDonnell, who was in Cantire, came
at once to the rescue. He landed at Cushendun only to find
that his castle on Red Bay was already burned and dismantled.
Sorley Boy had suffered severe loss while trying to stop
O&#8217;Neill in the pass of Knockboy, but he effected a junction
with the new comers. Sorley had a fortified residence at
Ballycastle, on the north coast, and thither Alexander Oge
was expected to bring a strong reinforcement. The brothers
retreated towards Ballycastle, but for some unaccountable
reason did not occupy it. Perhaps it was held by a hostile
garrison. Shane followed to the castle, the islemen, who
numbered about 1,000, lying in Glenshesk, and having thus
some advantage of rising ground. No help came, and very
early the next morning Shane made his attack. The O&#8217;Neills,
who were more than two to one, gained a complete victory.
According to Shane and his secretary, the Scots lost some
700 men, but other eye-witnesses reduce the number by one
half. James MacDonnell was dangerously wounded, and taken
prisoner. Sorley Boy was also taken, and a third brother,
Angus, was killed. Two chiefs of the Macleods, with many
other men of note, fell into the victor&#8217;s hands.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane

<p>On the following day Alexander Oge brought 900 men to
Rathlin, but returned to Scotland on hearing the bad news.
Dunseverick and other MacDonnell castles at once surrendered.
Dunluce, which was nearly impregnable by an Irish
army, held out for three days; but the garrison opened their
gates when they heard that Sorley Boy had had no food
during that time, and that his gentle captor would give him
none as long as the place held out. Shane remained the
unchallenged master of the North, and had the satisfaction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
bragging about the obligations under which he had placed
the Queen. His secretary, in a letter written some weeks
afterwards, said that O&#8217;Neill had exhorted his men before the
battle to be true to their Prince, that is, Queen Elizabeth; but
Shane, who wrote on the day of the fight, says nothing of this,
and his worthy secretary&#8217;s correspondent was Sir Thomas
Cusack, perhaps the only man living who would have believed
such a story.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney
advises the
Queen to
put him
down.</div>

<p>Cusack was much delighted at Shane&#8217;s services against
the Scots, and continued to write in glowing terms of his
good conformity. But others could tell of his twice plundering
Dundalk, and the Queen had already decided in her own
mind that Ireland could not be governed any longer by accommodation,
and had determined to send over Sir Henry Sidney,
cheaply, if possible, but if necessary, at any expense. Sidney&#8217;s
advice was plain. Leix and Offaly must be pacified by a general
pardon, followed by gentle dealings, or else the people must
be extirpated. The former would be the easier course, the
latter the more thorough. Munster might best be managed
by keeping the nobles at Court, and by appointing a President
and Council to rule it: 200 foot and 100 horse would be a
sufficient force. Thomond should be divided among as many
men as possible, supreme military command being given to
the Earl. The Scots should have no grant of land, which
would only be a back door for the Queen&#8217;s enemies. They
might be winked at until Government was strong enough to
expel them thoroughly; in the meantime all ports should be
held, so that the fleet might cut off access to the isles. As
for Shane, he was a common robber, never to be reformed
unless by force; O&#8217;Donnell should be restored, and Newry,
Dundalk, and Carrickfergus made thoroughly defensible, with
as little noise as possible. Shane O&#8217;Neill knew that he could
neither hoodwink Sidney nor hope to defeat him openly, and
he began a new correspondence with Scotland. He refused
to give up his prisoners to their Queen or to the Earl of
Argyle, until he knew the will of his own Queen; and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
meantime he talked about enormous ransoms. Secretary
Fleming says James MacDonnell offered O&#8217;Neill all his property
in Ireland and Scotland for bare liberty, but that Shane
declined on the ground that he was the Queen&#8217;s officer, and
that the quarrel was none of his. Treated with cruelty or
neglect, MacDonnell died of his wounds, and Shane, who
retained Sorley Boy by his side, soon began to talk about
marrying the widow, Lady Agnes Campbell. So matters
rested; while Sidney, among bitter recriminations, was forging
a sword for his old gossip&#8217;s destruction.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
and
Ormonde.</div>

<p>The war of the two great Houses did not end with Ormonde&#8217;s
victory at Affane, but was carried on vigorously in
London. Ormonde hated Leicester, and it is easy to see that
there was a certain difference of opinion, corresponding in
some degree to the Butler and Geraldine factions, between
the parties of Sussex and Leicester, both in England and
Ireland. Sussex, being interrogated, stated of his own
knowledge that Desmond had harboured proclaimed traitors
whom he refused to surrender, while Ormonde was always
ready to obey the Government in such matters. Desmond
had maintained the rebels in Thomond, and about this there
could be no doubt. Sussex showed by records that Sir
Maurice Fitzgerald&#8217;s lands were in the county of Waterford,
and that Desmond had no legal right there. Desmond, in
short, had been a disobedient subject, and an oppressor of
his neighbours, both Anglo-Norman and Celtic. Desmond
kept Sussex waiting three weeks at Waterford, and refused
to come to Dublin at all, though an ample escort was offered
him; while Ormonde was always ready to obey the summons
of the Government and Council. Sir Henry Radclyffe and
Francis Agarde, both of whom had good opportunities of
judging, spoke to the same effect.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Six weeks later, the controversy having waxed hot in the
meantime, Sidney was more decidedly favourable to Desmond.
The Earl&#8217;s entry into the Decies was indeed not justified by
law, but still less was Ormonde&#8217;s interference justifiable. Both
deserved punishment for unlawful assembly, but Desmond&#8217;s
should be the lighter, for that he had better colour of distress
than Ormonde of rescue. Desmond had but followed the
custom of his ancestors up to the time of the fight, and
whoever made the first onset should be answerable for the
slaughter. Both Earls should be made to contribute to the
support of a Presidency intended to bridle both, and in
future to obey, and to make others obey, as if they lived
within the Pale. Both should be bound in great sums to
stand to the decision of the Governor, Chancellor, and three
Chief Justices as to the lands in dispute between them.
Sussex, who fortified his argument by many references to
Acts of Parliament, urged that Desmond had committed
treason by his invasion of Waterford, and that Ormonde in
resisting him had done no more, or at least very little more,
than became a loyal subject of the Queen.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> But these statutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
were confessedly obsolete, and the Crown had winked at similar
irregularities too long and too often to insist on rigid
adherence to written law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The two
Earls
submit.</div>

<p>Desmond submitted to the Queen to abide her judgment
concerning the many treasons, murders, burnings, and other
such things objected to him by the Privy Council since he
last received pardon. Ormonde did the same, protesting his
peaceable intention in entering the Decies. Both Earls
entered into recognizances in 20,000<i>l.</i> to abide such orders as
her Majesty might prescribe. With a view of bridling Desmond,
MacCarthy More was created Earl of Clancare, and
Sir Owen O&#8217;Sullivan received a grant of his country subject
to such rents and services as the new-made Earl could prove
himself entitled to.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney will
not go to
Ireland
unless his
demands
are
granted.</div>

<p>The general voice both of England and Ireland pointed
to Sidney as the fittest man to govern. But he knew well
that he was more likely to lose a great reputation than to
gain fresh laurels, and he determined not to go unless treated
fairly. He declined to be responsible for any debts contracted
by his predecessors, and required a clear balance-sheet
to start with. Stores must be put in decent order, and
at least 200 horse and 500 foot given him over and above the
usual establishment. Every captain should have the pay of
eight dead men borne on the books, so as to enable him to
reward deserving soldiers. It was desirable that St. Patrick&#8217;s
should be turned into a military hospital. Dublin Castle,
Kilmainham, Leighlin Bridge, and Carlow must be put in
repair. The Great Seal should be given to a good English
lawyer, and Archbishop Curwen should be suitably provided
for in England.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Some of his
conditions.</div>

<p>By serving the Queen Sidney complained that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
3,000<i>l.</i> poorer. His plate and his wife&#8217;s jewels were in pawn.
To secure him from further impoverishment he asked for an
ample commission, to be continued Lord President of Wales
for life or during good behaviour, and to have the right of
going to the Queen at all times without license. The privilege
of making steel, and the right to export 6,000 coarse-dressed
cloths and corn for his own household, were the other
means by which he proposed to stave off financial ruin. &#8216;If
you will not grant these things,&#8217; he said to the Queen, &#8216;give
me leave to serve you anywhere except in Ireland, or to live
private shall be more joyous to me than all the rest and to go
thither.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The terms
actually
granted.</div>

<p>Sidney&#8217;s demands were only partially granted. He was
allowed to retain the presidency of Wales. His salary was
the same as his predecessors. He had license to export provisions
for his household, but nothing was said about the
coarse-dressed cloths. Some of the ruined castles were to be
restored, Kilmainham at the expense of the lessees, Dublin
and Carrickfergus at that of the Government. The military
force was not to be increased, and Sidney was expected to
heal the distracted land with 882 soldiers and 300 kerne.
It was even supposed that he could put down piracy, for
though the Queen was willing to lend a ship and a pinnace,
she refused to give a single sailor, and coolly told her representative
that he might man them out of his ordinary garrison.
The captains were allowed six &#8216;dead pays&#8217; instead of
the eight which were asked for. All ecclesiastical patronage
was vested in the new Governor, except archbishoprics and
bishoprics, and he had the appointment of all civil officers
except the Chancellor, the Treasurer, the sub-Treasurer, the
Chief Justice of the Queen&#8217;s Bench, the Chief Baron, and
the Master of the Rolls. The powers given to Sidney were
almost identical with those which Sussex had enjoyed. It
was at first intended to give him the title of Lord-Lieutenant
also, but either because his importunities annoyed the Queen,
or to lessen the mortification which the Earl may be supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to have felt, Sidney was obliged to be content with the lower
title of Lord Deputy.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney&#8217;s
instructions.</div>

<p>Sidney received minute instructions as to the principles
on which he was to conduct the Government. He was to
make close inquiry as to the best available means for establishing
the &#8216;Christian religion&#8217; among the people, and St.
Patrick&#8217;s was to be at once surveyed, with a view to founding
a college. The judicial bench was to be purged of partial
men; and if necessary, lawyers with increased stipends would
be sent from England. The jurisdiction of the courts was
to be extended as much as possible in the Irish districts.
Sheriffs were to be regularly appointed for Leix, Offaly, and for
what is now the county of Wicklow. The Celtic countries
between the Shannon and the Pale were, if possible, to be
joined to Meath, or to the King&#8217;s and Queen&#8217;s Counties.
Besides the five shires of the Pale, Carlow, Wexford, Kilkenny,
Waterford, Tipperary, Cork, Kerry, and Limerick
were, as a matter of course, to be considered under the law;
and Desmond and Ormonde were to protect sheriffs and coroners
in the execution of their duties. A Presidency would be
established for Munster, and perhaps another for Connaught;
and in the meantime every means was to be taken to substitute
English manners for Irish customs, fixed payments
for arbitrary exactions, and estates of inheritance for tribal
chiefries. Many existing statutes were unknown, because
they had never been printed, and Sidney was directed to send
exemplifications of such as appeared fit to be published and
observed.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Revenue.</div>

<p>The finances were to be reformed, if possible, without
further charge to the Queen, and with greater ease to the
subject, an impossible task, which Sidney well knew that he
could never perform. Many of the rules laid down were, however,
very good, and it was clearly seen that much of the
financial confusion arose from private jobbing, and from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
faulty system of public accounts. What Elizabeth would not
as yet see was that the first and greatest irregularity consisted
in leaving soldiers unpaid, and in fixing salaries at rates
which would not support the incumbents. In order to keep
the reforming spirit alive, the Lord Deputy and Council were
ordered to read their instructions over every three months,
and to report progress to the Queen. &#8216;How strange a thing
it may seem to be,&#8217; says her Majesty in Council, &#8216;that such a
realm as that is, where no just cause is to fear invasion of any
other prince, where any person dwelling in that land has never
directly or indirectly denied the sovereignty of that Crown to
belong to the Crown of England, yet nevertheless to remain
so chargeable to the Crown of England for the governance
thereof only, and the revenues thereof to be so mean as the
like burden and charge is not found in any place of Christendom,
where commonly though the countries be subject to
titles of other princes, or full of rebellions even for the sovereignties,
yet the same do contribute sufficiently to the charge
for their own government.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Private
instructions.</div>

<p>Besides the public instructions, Sidney received others for
his own use only. Elizabeth had evidently still some hope
of Shane, and desired to temporise with him, and with the
Scots; in the meantime extending the rule of Carrickfergus
as far as possible, and perhaps fortifying Carlingford and other
coast towns. Shane&#8217;s claims were to be strictly scrutinised
in Parliament, and Sidney was to confer personally with him,
and to give him a safe-conduct if he demanded it. If still
undutiful, he was to be left to his fate, which could not but
overtake him at last.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Treatment

<p>O&#8217;Donnell was to go back to Ireland, to be supported by
the Government in Dublin, and restored, if possible, by policy
and not by war. Yet war would be preferred to Shane&#8217;s
holding Tyrconnel. The O&#8217;Reillys were to be persuaded into
holding their lands of the Crown, and into making their
country as obedient to law as those of Desmond and Ormonde
were supposed to be, but were not. Sir John of Desmond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
was to be sent to England as a sort of hostage for his brother&#8217;s
performance of promises lately made.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
writes a
private
letter to
Sidney.</div>

<p>Even more interesting than these private instructions is
a letter which Elizabeth herself wrote to Sidney. It is in her
usual involved style, and must be read over and over before it
yields its full meaning. The Queen&#8217;s chief object seems to
have been to make Sidney take a view favourable to Ormonde
in his controversy with Desmond. Too many, she said, were
partial to the latter. &#8216;If I did not see the balances held awry,
I had never myself come into the weighhouse.&#8217; &#8216;Make some
difference,&#8217; she said, &#8216;between tried, just, and false friends.
Let the good service of well deservers be never rewarded with
loss. Let their thank be such as may encourage more strivers
for the like. Suffer not that Desmond&#8217;s "denyinge dedes,"
far wide from promised work, make you trust to other pledge
than either himself or John for gage; he hath so well performed
his English vows, that I warn you trust him no longer
than you see one of them. Prometheus let me be, and Prometheus
hath been mine too long ... then are we ever
knitting a knot never tied, yea, and if our web be framed
with rotten hurdles, when our loom is well-nigh done, our
work is new to begin.... Let this memorial be only committed
to Vulcan&#8217;s base keeping without any longer abode
than the leisure of the reading thereof, yea, and with no
mention made thereof to any other wight. I charge you as I
may command you. Seem not to have had but secretaries&#8217;
letters from me.&#8217; The letter nevertheless was kept safely at
Penshurst, where Arthur Collins found it in the reign of
George II.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arnold&#8217;s
policy not
successful.</div>

<p>Like many who have tried their hands at the Irish problem,
Sir Nicholas Arnold began with great professions, and
after much disturbing men&#8217;s minds showed that he was no
cleverer than those who had gone before him. Great as his
failure had been in dealing with Shane, Sussex had at least
kept tolerable order in the districts which paid some regard
to law. Arnold was accused of caring little whether there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
was war or peace. His harsh treatment of the O&#8217;Connors has
been already noticed, and the O&#8217;Reillys were handled in much
the same way. They had plundered on the border of the
Pale, and Shane O&#8217;Neill, anxious to assert his power, offered
to compel restitution. Arnold preferred to make Kildare the
instrument of punishment. A parley was first held, and
promise of restitution made by old Malachias O&#8217;Reilly and his
sons, Hugh and Edmund. Cahir O&#8217;Reilly, the chief offender,
was to be punished. It soon appeared that Cahir was out of
reach in Shane&#8217;s country, and that some of the hostages demanded
were also there. The camp was the scene of much
confusion, Kildare&#8217;s men threatening and even throwing stones
at Sir George Stanley, the Marshal, and raising the ominous
cries of &#8216;Cromaboo!&#8217; and &#8216;Down with the English churls!&#8217;
The Earl with difficulty pacified his men, but Arnold, who all
along showed the most extraordinary subservience to Kildare,
and was on the worst terms with Stanley, declined to notice
the outrage.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
O&#8217;Reillys.</div>

<p>A remarkable conversation took place between Arnold and
Hugh O&#8217;Reilly, whom he urged to take the government of
the country on himself. Hugh answered that O&#8217;Donnell was
evil spoken of for assuming the government while his father
lived, and that he saw not those punished who killed the
Queen&#8217;s subjects. Shane O&#8217;Neill murdered his father, and
procured the murder of his brother, who was five times as
valuable to the Crown as any O&#8217;Reilly could be. The politicians
of the Pale would maintain his half brother against
him, and perhaps seek his life. If O&#8217;Neill ceased to protect
Cahir, &#8216;then,&#8217; said Hugh, &#8216;I say for O&#8217;Reilly, your prisoner,
and for his eldest son, if any of them receive men or meat
from O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s country, I will die but they shall be delivered
to your governor, or all their hurts past be paid for presently.&#8217;
He was quite willing to give hostages, but not to undertake
to give those beyond his reach. According to Fitzwilliam
Hugh meant well, and in any case the original aggressor was
not Cahir O&#8217;Reilly but Kildare himself. Any damage done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
to the Pale had been more than paid for already. &#8216;Arnold,&#8217;
he said, &#8216;means well, but Ireland, in my opinion, though it
be brute and rude, is not known to every man for a year or
two&#8217;s trial.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mistakes
of Arnold.</div>

<p>No doubt Arnold had a hard task, but it is clear that he
was not the man to make it easier. The Queen&#8217;s best officers
in Ireland were slighted daily. The Lord Justice treated
Archbishop Loftus with marked rudeness at the Council Board.
The Irish service had so completely bewitched him that no
Englishman could look for favour. Everything was hoped
for from Shane, whom he praised continually to the Queen,
though obliged to remind O&#8217;Neill himself that his deeds were
not so very laudable. Seeing that the men who opposed him
favoured Ormonde, Arnold was in all things partial to Kildare,
and to the Geraldine party generally. The irregularities which
he found in every branch of the public service were really
matters of long standing, hardly to be visited on individuals,
and largely the fault of the Home Government. Arnold insinuated
many things against Vice-Treasurer Fitzwilliam; but
when Fitzwilliam&#8217;s accounts were produced they were found
to be quite correct. Stanley was recalled less because of
Arnold&#8217;s accusations than because he was disliked by Sidney,
and the Queen particularly stated that she did not despise the
Marshal&#8217;s service, nor credit the reports against him. The
difficulty of finding out the exact truth was no doubt very
great. Even Cecil was not always well served, for portions
of a letter addressed by Fitzwilliam to him were copied out,
and transmitted to Arnold. Excuses may be made for a man
who with good intentions had raised a hornet&#8217;s nest about his
ears; but he was evidently quarrelsome, arbitrary, credulous,
and deficient in personal dignity, a quality which probably
carries as much weight in Ireland as in any country in the
world.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

rather partial to Ormonde. The &#8216;ford&#8217; of Affane was perhaps that over the
tributary river Finisk. I have inspected the ground carefully. The Blackwater
itself is mentioned by Desmond as being passable only by swimming
or in boats. It is, on the other hand, generally believed that the ford in
question was over the great river, and arms and spurs have been found
near the bank. The Finisk, however, was on Ormonde&#8217;s direct road to
Dromana, and the Blackwater was not.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney
arrives in
Ireland,
1566.</div>

<p>Sidney was wind-bound for nearly two months in Wales and
Cheshire. He and his wife were forced to flit about the
coast, staying sometimes in places where food, drink, and
lodging were alike bad, weary of their lives, and with no
news more cheering than that one vessel carrying their horses
and furniture had foundered with all hands, and that the
cargo of another had been much damaged, though the men
were saved. &#8216;God send me a better proceed,&#8217; said he, &#8216;and a
good end of this froward beginning.&#8217; He lost all his wine
and other property, worth 1,500<i>l.</i>, and was inclined to attribute
to witchcraft an extraordinary series of storms which
shattered nearly all the ships between Liverpool and Chester.
William Thwaites, a faithful and useful servant, perished,
and Sidney mourned his loss more than any quantity of property.
The Lord gave, he said, and the Lord hath taken
away. The stone pier at Chester was ruined, and Sidney, not
forgetting that he was Lord President of Wales, declared that
the city would be irreparably damaged unless the Queen sent
help. Yet great as the storm was, he feared lest his jealous
mistress should accuse him of loitering, and begged the Vice-President
of the Welsh Marches to corroborate his accounts
of the weather. He wished Cecil a long life, and himself a
speedy departure from &#8216;this hungry head.&#8217; Elizabeth afterwards
expressed sorrow for Sidney&#8217;s losses, but it does not
appear that she did anything in the way of compensating
him. At last the wind changed, and Sidney found himself
in charge of a country as unquiet as the sea that washed her
shores.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Sidney and
Shane
O&#8217;Neill.</div>

<p>Sidney&#8217;s first care was to let Shane O&#8217;Neill know of his
arrival, and to urge him to appoint a meeting at Drogheda or
Dundalk. Shane answered by praising Arnold&#8217;s government,
and proposed that his successor should be at Dundalk on
February 5, which he thought would be conducive to business.
Sidney thought the date too early, especially as Cusack was
not at hand, and suggested that if O&#8217;Neill were sincere he
might fix a better day, promising, in the meantime, to punish
a satirical versifier who had offended him. Shane then declined
a meeting until his latest suits were favourably determined,
but promised to wait on the border for seven days,
during which he hoped the Lord Deputy would come to
Dundalk. To this it was answered that the treaty of Nov. 18,
1563, had not come to hand, that Cusack, who knew all about
it, was sick in Munster, and that in the meantime Shane
might as well come under safe-conduct. The slippery chief
was kind enough to say that he took the Lord Deputy&#8217;s delay
in good part, and that Sidney could not desire his presence
more than he desired Sidney&#8217;s. He knew the latter&#8217;s sweet
nature and readiness for all good things, and reminded him of
their former friendly relations. His people, he said, would
not allow him to come to the Lord Deputy&#8217;s presence, on
account of the many hurts done by official people to the
O&#8217;Neills during the last twenty years. The imprisonment of
his father, the handcuffs which secured his own safety on the
way to Court, the two attempts of Sussex to murder him, were
duly recapitulated, as well as many outrages upon Irishmen
of less importance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney
pronounces
Shane
hopeless.</div>

<p>Sidney could only say that Shane ought to know him
better, and that he was quite willing to meet him at Dundalk.
But he declined to enter any house or town, desiring the Lord
Deputy to meet him at a bog-side where he had 1,000
men with him. Sidney could not bring half as many men,
and he did not think such a meeting for the Queen&#8217;s honour.
Shane stickled for the old treaty with Cusack, who was absent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and Kildare, who was present, remembered nothing about it.
It had never been on record in Ireland, and the copies produced
by O&#8217;Neill and by Leicester agreed, &#8216;as well as Luke
the Evangelist and Huon of Bordeaux.&#8217; Lucifer was never
more puffed up with pride and ambition than O&#8217;Neill, who
was the only strong and rich man in Ireland, able to bring
4,000 foot and 1,000 horse into the field. If he did not come
to Sidney, he would come to no Englishman, and since the
first conquest there had not been any man in Ireland more
likely to bring it under the dominion of a foreign prince.
&#8216;In the morning he is subtle, and then will he cause letters
to be written either directly otherwise than he will do, or else
so doubtfully as he may make what construction he likes, and
ofttimes his secretary penneth his letters in more dulled form
than he giveth him instruction, but in the afternoon when the
wine is in, then unfoldeth he himself, <i>in vino veritas</i>, then
showeth he himself what he is, and what he is likely to
attempt.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane&#8217;s
pretensions
to be
greater
than any
earl.</div>

<p>Formerly he had condescended to request that his parliamentary
robes might be sent into his own country. &#8216;Now
he cares not to be an Earl unless he can be something higher
and better. "I am," he said, "in blood and power better
than the best of them. I will give place to none but my
cousin of Kildare, for that he is of my House. You have made
a wise Earl of Macarthy More, I keep as good a man as he.
For the Queen, I confess she is my sovereign lady, yet I
never made peace with her but by her own seeking. And
whom would you have me trust, Mr. Stukeley? I came unto
the Earl of Sussex upon the safe-conduct of two Earls and
protection under the Great Seal, and the first courtesy that he
offered was to put me in a handlock and to send me into
England. When I came there upon pardon and safe-conduct,
and had done my business and would have departed according
the same, the Queen herself told me that indeed safe-conduct
I had to come safe and go safe, but she had not told
me when, and so there held me till I had agreed to such inconvenience
against my honour and profit as I would never
perform while I live, and that made me make war. If it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
were to do again, I would do it, for my ancestors were kings
of Ulster, Ulster was theirs, and shall be mine. And for
O&#8217;Donnell, he shall never come into his country if I can keep
him out of it, nor Bagenal into the Newry, nor the Earl of
Kildare into Dundrum or Lecale. They are mine; with this
sword I won them, with this sword I will keep them. This
is my answer, commend me to my gossip the Deputy. God
be with you, my masters." "Nay," said the envoys, "we
brought you letters, and by letters we look for answer."
"Well, letters you shall have," said he, and he caused his
secretary to write. We send a true copy, so that you shall
see how well speech and writing agree.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney is
obliged to
temporise.</div>

<p>Persuasion had failed, as Sidney doubtless foresaw, and
he was in no condition to carry things with a high hand.
He reiterated the demands he had already made in England,
and declared he could do nothing till they were granted. A
competent Chancellor, a President for Munster, money to pay
off the demoralised soldiers and get new ones who had not
graduated in idleness and extortion; these were the most
pressing wants. 4,000<i>l.</i> should be spent out of hand in fortifications,
and means should be given to victual all garrisons at
once, instead of waiting till the last moment and then paying
double. The Lord Deputy had not even a good clerk whom he
could trust to copy despatches, still less could he do good service
with soldiers who lived by plunder and were everywhere allied
with the Irish. With 500 well-paid and well-appointed men he
would chase Shane before him within forty-eight hours, or be
accounted a traitor. Otherwise he might come to the walls of
Dublin and go away unfought. Ulster was ready for the
foreigner to seize, and a whole province would be worse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
England than the single town of Calais had been to France.
He had rather die than have the name of losing Ireland, and
yet he could do nothing without proper tools. Six thousand
times a day did he wish himself in any part of Christendom,
so that he might escape from the Irish purgatory, with its
endless and thankless toil.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sussex
and
Leicester
factions.</div>

<p>The presence of Sussex at Court was not favourable to his
successor&#8217;s efforts in Ireland. Smarting under the sense of
failure, he was ready to find fault, and he or his friends
accused Sidney of using improper language. The party
opposed to Leicester, including Ormonde, whose favour with
the Queen was such as to cause some slight scandal, eagerly
welcomed rumours unfavourable to the favourite&#8217;s brother-in-law.
Sidney denied in vigorous language that he had
slandered Sussex in any way, though he knew him to be his
enemy. &#8216;That evil,&#8217; he said, &#8216;come to me and mine, I pray
God, that I wish to him.&#8217; At last Elizabeth confronted
Sussex and Leicester at the Council Board, and the result was
a complete vindication of Sidney. But the unconciliatory tone
of Sussex made the scene painful, and such as Cecil would
have given much to avoid. Though angry with Sidney for
his coldness to Ormonde, for the favour shown to Stukeley,
and above all, for his financial importunities, the Queen
pacified him by a graceful letter, and his credit seems to have
been fully re-established at Court.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Elizabeth
sends Sir
F. Knollys
to discover
the truth.
He supports
Sidney.</div>

<p>Like every English ruler before and since, Elizabeth
found it very hard to get at the truth about Ireland. She
now sent her Vice-Chamberlain, Sir F. Knollys, with large
powers, and with directions to keep the chief part of the information
he might acquire for her own ear. It was now evident
that no good could be expected of Shane, and the question
was how could he best be subdued. Cecil wrote privately to
Sidney, advising him to speak favourably of Ormonde when
conversing with Knollys. Whether he followed this prudent
counsel or not, it is clear that the Lord Deputy succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
impressing his views on the special commissioner, who was
much struck by his powers of work. That the Queen lost great
sums by the system of long credits, and that discipline suffered
by irregular payments, may seem elementary truths, but her
Majesty was slow to receive them. She was startled by the
proposal of a winter war, upon which Sidney and Knollys
insisted, and of which St. Leger had demonstrated the value.
Hitherto the usual plan had been to begin campaigning in
spring, which is often a cold season in Ireland. The horses
which had been kept in during the winter could not bear the
exposure nor the green food. Little harm could be done to
the young crops, and the Irish horses, which had been out all
the winter, improved daily. There was plenty of milk and
butter, and the cattle could find food everywhere. The true
plan was to begin about harvest, to destroy as much ripe corn
as possible, and to drive the Irish herds into flooded woods
and bogs. Armed vessels should be provided to prevent the
entry of Scots, 300 of whom Knollys believed to be more
formidable than 600 Irish kerne.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
hesitates.</div>

<p>Though believing at heart that Shane would have to be
subdued by force, Elizabeth hesitated to act on her conviction.
Sidney implored Cecil to persuade her at least to spare her
own purse, &#8216;though there be little care of this country and
less of me.... I will give you all my land in Rutlandshire
to get me leave to go into Hungary, and think myself
bound to you while I live. I trust there to do my country
some honour, here I do neither good to Queen, country, nor
to myself.&#8217; Cecil worked hard to persuade his mistress, and
at last she yielded, slowly and ungraciously, grumbling at the
expense, and magnifying the objections to the course which
she knew to be inevitable. To avoid the difficulty of provisioning
an army in winter, it was resolved to make a permanent
settlement in the extreme North. Three hundred
seasoned soldiers from Berwick, 100 men from London, and
600 more from the Western counties, were to be placed under
the experienced guidance of Colonel Randolph, and furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
with proper supplies. O&#8217;Donnell should be replaced in his
country, and a naval expedition should secure the coast
against any invasion from Scotland. All this was in strict
accordance with the advice of Sidney and Knollys. An agent
was sent to Scotland with friendly messages to Mary, and
complaints of aid given to Shane. He was directed to sound
Argyle, and to impress him and his friends with the idea
that the Papists were Shane&#8217;s real supporters. This was
true enough, for he had begged for French troops, styling himself
defender of the faith in Ireland, and offering the Crown
of Ireland to the most Christian King, when the English
schismatics should be driven out. Nor had he omitted to
send a representative to the Scots Court, impudently informing
Sidney that he had sent him at the request of Argyle,
and that he had gone thither only &#8216;to show the monstrous
glibbe that he wore upon his head.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Insolence
of Shane.
Mission of
Randolph.</div>

<p>While a weapon was being slowly forged for his destruction,
Shane assumed the offensive and threatened the Pale.
He refused to treat unless his servant, as he called Maguire,
should be given up to him. Sidney faced him for two days
near Dundalk, and was then forced to retire for want of provisions,
first advising the inhabitants to place their goods in
safety&mdash;a precaution which many did not or could not take.
No sooner was his back turned than Shane advanced and
burned Haggardston and most of the villages in the north part
of Louth. He then attacked Dundalk, whose walls were
ruinous enough, but John Fitzwilliam, with a small number
of soldiers, made so good a stand that the Irish were driven
off with great loss, though they had actually penetrated into
the streets. Twenty-six heads, representing but a small part
of the slain, were left grinning on the gates. Shane then
withdrew towards the border of Tyrconnel, and made great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
offers to the Scots; but Sidney had been beforehand with
him, and no help came. He and all his adherents were proclaimed
traitors at Drogheda, and a day was fixed for attacking
him in force. But money difficulties caused a further
delay, though Gresham went to Antwerp on purpose, and
though Cecil pledged his own credit for what to us seems the
small sum of 1,100<i>l.</i> Then the winds were adverse, and Shane
had reaped most of his harvest before Randolph had left
Bristol. A month later than had been originally intended
all difficulties were surmounted, and Sidney moved forward as
soon as he heard that the expedition had arrived in Lough
Foyle.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
will not
help Shane.
Sidney goes
to Ulster.</div>

<p>Shane O&#8217;Neill felt that he was near the end of his tether,
and made a strong effort to create a diversion in Munster.
He reminded the Desmonds that he had often defended their
interests, which were identical with his own, and that there
was now a grand opportunity of defeating the English policy,
which was as hostile to the Norman as to the Celtic aristocracy.
But Desmond turned a deaf ear and went in person to
Sidney, even to that town of Drogheda which was traditionally
hateful to his family, and offered to accompany him to Ulster
with or without his followers. Sidney assigned him a post
on the border, which he was to guard with the help of Lords
Dunboyne, Power, and Delvin, and of Sir Warham St. Leger,
who had charge of the affairs of Munster. Accompanied by
Kildare, O&#8217;Donnell, and Maguire, the Deputy then began his
northward march. After halting four days on the border of
Louth to allow supplies to come up, Sidney marched towards
Armagh. A lake, which is not easy to identify, was passed
on the way, and in this lake there was one of the ancient
dwellings called &#8216;crannoges,&#8217; which were still used as hiding-places
by the O&#8217;Neills. It was supposed that Shane deposited
his money, plate, and prisoners in these primitive strongholds,
and that may have made the Lord Deputy anxious to
gain them. He describes the island as surrounded by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
thick hedge, and &#8216;bearded with stakes and other sharp wood.&#8217;
A rude pontoon bridge was made with barrels, and a party
advanced to the assault. But the soldiers crowded on to the
planks till they were partly submerged, and thus destroyed
the combustibles with which it was intended to burn the hedge
and stockade. Two or three were drowned, and Sidney resolved
to lose no more time.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney has
it all his
own way.
Death of
Shane
Maguire.</div>

<p>The army then advanced to Armagh, where Shane had
burned the church and destroyed all the buildings that he
could. In crossing the Blackwater, which was now very low,
a further justification appeared for an autumn campaign. In
some former expeditions undertaken in springtime all the
provisions had been exhausted while waiting for the river
to become fordable. Shane&#8217;s chief residence at Benburb was
found in ruins, and on the tenth day Clogher was reached.
Some of the corn had been carried off, but the greater part
was still accessible, and all within a circuit of twenty-four
miles was destroyed. While lagging in the rear with some
horse Kildare was here attacked by the O&#8217;Neills, and had a
narrow escape. Near Omagh Shane Maguire died on the
march, just as he was about to be restored to his own. At or
near Castlederg Shane showed himself in the rear, but did
not venture even to skirmish, though the ground was very
unfavourable to English troops, and though he had near 5,000
men with him. At the ruined castle of Lifford, Randolph
met Sidney and satisfied him that Derry, with its church and
other stone houses, was the best place for a fortress. On the
right bank of the Foyle opposite to the entrenchment the
whole army halted. O&#8217;Dogherty and the Bishop of Derry,
who was of his family, then came to Sidney; but none of the
O&#8217;Donnells appeared, and the Lord Deputy found it necessary
to enter Tyrconnel in person. The Foyle was accordingly
passed, not without difficulty, and leaving six companies and
six weeks&#8217; provisions with Randolph, he marched by Raphoe
through Barnesmore gap into Tyrconnel, and arrived at
Donegal without seeing an enemy. He was joined on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
march by O&#8217;Boyle, by two chiefs of the MacSwineys, by
O&#8217;Gallagher, and by the Bishop of Raphoe, one of those prelates
who had attended the Council of Trent. Donegal was taken
formal possession of, and then delivered to O&#8217;Donnell, as was
also Ballyshannon. The Erne was then passed in boats brought
from Donegal, and Shane&#8217;s people abandoned Belleek Castle,
which they vainly tried to burn, and which Sidney gave up
to the O&#8217;Donnells to hold of the Queen. Passing between
Lough Melvin and the sea, the army marched unopposed to
Sligo. O&#8217;Connor surrendered the castle, which he desired to
hold of the Queen independently of O&#8217;Donnell. Sidney directed
him to pay one year&#8217;s rent pending a regular trial of the title,
and then proceeded to Boyle by the pass over the Curlew
mountains, &#8216;the foulest place that ever we passed in Ireland.&#8217;
The value of the fertile plains of Boyle was apparent to Sidney,
who regretted that they were spoiled by local wars and yielded
nothing to her Majesty. From Boyle the army went by
Roscommon to Athlone, where the Shannon was passed by
swimming, some baggage horses being lost. &#8216;Thanks be to
God,&#8217; said Sidney, &#8216;in all this painful and long journey there
died not of sickness above three persons, and the rest in such
health as the like hath not been seen in so long a journey in
this land, and the horses also in better plight than with so
great travail they could have been in the beginning of the
year. And like as by this journey your Majesty hath recovered
to your obedience a country of seventy miles in length
and forty-eight miles in breadth, and the service of 1,000 men
now restored to O&#8217;Donnell, and so united and confirmed in
love towards him, as they be ready to follow him whithersoever
he shall lead them, so is your Majesty&#8217;s name grown in
no small veneration among the Irishry, who now see cause to
appeal to your justice; and by this restitution of O&#8217;Donnell
receive both hope and fear to be defended in their well-doing,
and chastised for the contrary.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Randolph
at Derry.
Death of
Calvagh
O&#8217;Donnell.</div>

<p>After Sidney&#8217;s departure Randolph found his position one
of great difficulty. The people had no other idea of trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
than to extort exorbitant prices. The supplies were inadequate,
and the soldiers were quickly reduced from cheese and bacon to
bread and pease only. Their clothes soon wore out, and messengers
had to be sent into the Irish districts for frieze and to
England for shirts and shoes. Intrenching tools failed, for
twenty dozen spades and shovels had been used up, and
O&#8217;Donnell could not rebuild Lifford without help. Powder ran
low. There were no boats to carry horses. The men sickened.
An unexpected event added still further to their perplexity.
As old Calvagh O&#8217;Donnell was riding towards Derry on his
way to attack Tyrone his horse stumbled and fell, and he
was seized with a fit, which soon carried him off. He lived
just long enough to call his chief clansmen round him, to
speak of the Queen&#8217;s kindness, and to adjure them to serve her
and to fulfil every promise that he had made. His brother
Hugh was quickly chosen to succeed him, but the confusion
probably hindered supplies from reaching the garrison at
Derry. Shane seized the opportunity to invade Tyrconnel,
but O&#8217;Dogherty gave warning and the fords were closely
watched. Randolph routed the assailants with great slaughter,

the commander, and his loss was not easily supplied.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney goes
to Munster.
Great
disorder
everywhere.</div>

<p>Determined not to let O&#8217;Neill rest, Sidney ordered a
general hosting against the O&#8217;Reillys, O&#8217;Hanlons, and others of
his partisans, which is only so far noteworthy in that Desmond
and the White Knight co-operated with Sir Warham St.
Leger, who had been acting as chief commissioner in Munster,
and whom it was at this time intended to make Lord President.
Butlers and Geraldines continued nevertheless to plunder one
another, Sidney refusing to decide their cause without the help
of English lawyers, and the Queen pressing him continually
in Ormonde&#8217;s interest. In the meantime he could see the
state of Munster for himself. He found the Queen&#8217;s County
and Kilkenny in pretty good order, and very prosperous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
compared to what he had formerly seen there. Ormonde&#8217;s
brother Piers was arraigned for breaking into a gaol and releasing
men charged with felony, and on confession was
respited during the Queen&#8217;s pleasure. Edward, another brother
of the Earl, distinguished himself by apprehending certain
outlaws who annoyed the Fitzpatricks, and who were sheltered
in Tipperary. The Fitzpatricks were, however, in the habit
of retaliating on Kilkenny. The O&#8217;Carrolls Sidney found
quiescent, and their chief willing to pay rent to the Queen,
and anxious for a peerage. Between the Fitzpatricks, the
Desmonds, and the Butlers themselves, Tipperary was in evil
case, suffering especially from &#8216;the excessive train of horsemen
and footmen led and kept there by the younger brethren
of the Earl of Ormonde, who rather consumed than defended
the goods of the poor country.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Palatinate
of
Tipperary.</div>

<p>Indeed, those who bore authority under the Earl showed
neither justice, judgment, nor stoutness in the Deputy&#8217;s
opinion, and the townsmen of Clonmel, Cashel, and Fethard,
sustained him in his dislike of the palatinate jurisdiction.
Trade was so much interrupted by violence that the towns
underwent the inconveniences of a perpetual siege. Lord
Dunboyne with his brother and son were sent to Dublin
Castle. &#8216;If maintenance of proclaimed rebels,&#8217; said Patrick
Sherlock, openly at Fethard in his lordship&#8217;s presence and
in that of the Deputy, &#8216;murderers, and burners of corn and
houses, are treason to the Queen&#8217;s person, then I have to
accuse him of treason.&#8217; Edward Butler was tried at Clonmel
and acquitted, yet Sidney thought a good moral effect would
result from the mere fact of bringing the Earl&#8217;s brother into
court.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Waterford.</div>

<p>The county of Waterford was also disturbed by the Power
kerne and others, who had been used to live by coyne and
livery. That exaction having been repressed by St. Leger
and his colleagues, they betook themselves to undisguised
rapine. Lord Power was also sent to the Castle, as the best
means of inducing his followers to amend their lives. Sir
Maurice Fitzgerald&#8217;s county contrasted favourably both with
Lord Power&#8217;s and with the Desmond territory about Youghal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
but the chief was somewhat too ready to take the law into his
own hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cork.</div>

<p>Youghal itself had suffered much from pirates. Here
Desmond appeared, and Sidney went into the controversy
about the possession of Kilsheelan and some other manors.
He found that Ormonde was in the right, and from the time
that decision was given Desmond gave him all the trouble
in his power. &#8216;Your name,&#8217; said the Deputy to Queen
Elizabeth, &#8216;is no more reverenced, nor letters of commandment
obeyed, within any place within his rule, than it would
be in the kingdom of France.&#8217; But the greater part of the
noblemen and gentlemen of Cork came to Sidney craving
justice and protection against the Desmond tyranny.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Horrible
destitution
of the
people.</div>

<p>The absence of a stable government and the trade with
Spain had, in Sidney&#8217;s opinion, so weakened the Crown that
Philip might, with 3,000 men and 20,000<i>l.</i>, become supreme
in Munster and Connaught, which 20,000 men and 100,000<i>l.</i>
would not suffice to recover. The whole county of Cork was
waste, the villages burned, and everywhere were exposed
&#8216;bones and skulls of the dead subjects, who, partly by murder,
partly by famine, have died in the fields, as in troth hardly
any Christian with dry eyes could behold.&#8217; Women upon the
point of becoming mothers were murdered by one of Desmond&#8217;s
vassals, and the Earl lodged and feasted in the murderer&#8217;s
house. &#8216;Surely,&#8217; said Sidney, &#8216;there was never people that
lived in more misery than they do, nor as it should seem of
worse minds, for matrimony among them is no more regarded
in effect than conjunction between unreasonable beasts. Perjury,
robbery, and murder counted allowable. Finally, I
cannot find that they make any conscience of sin, and I doubt
whether they christen their children or no; for neither find I
place where it should be done, nor any person able to instruct
them in the rules of a Christian; or if they were taught I
see no grace in them to follow it; and when they die I cannot
see they make any account of the world to come.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Desmond, who was given to bravado, attempted to over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>awe
Sidney, who had but 200 men with him. He boasted
that he would never dispense with the old state of his family,
but would have five gallowglasses where he had formerly had
one. He secretly directed his dependents to make a show of
force, but Sidney told him that he would hold him responsible
if anything happened, and finally sent him through Clare and
Connaught a prisoner to Dublin. He did not, however, believe
that rebellion was meant, but merely empty display. In
the meantime the English Government received information
which, had it been earlier available, would have prevented
Desmond&#8217;s last enlargement.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney

his
journey.
Limerick.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Galway.</div>

<p>At Limerick, Sidney was received by the Bishop, Hugh
Lacy, in full pontificals, and with much ceremony of an
entirely Roman character. The city he found much decayed,
partly through the misdeeds of Desmond, but more through
those of the Earl of Thomond, who was both incompetent and
treacherous. Galway more &#8216;resembled a town of war, frontiering
upon an enemy, than a civil town in a country under
the sovereign. They watch their walls nightly, and guard
their gates daily with armed men.&#8217; Clanricarde&#8217;s sons John
and Ulick, by two wives both living, were the chief disturbers
of the West, and they too were sent prisoners to Dublin.
The town of Athenry was deserted, four families only remaining,
who greeted the Viceroy with cries of &#8216;Succour, succour.&#8217;
Clanricarde&#8217;s own country was in pretty good condition, and
Sidney found nothing to complain of in his conduct, but he
was quite unable to keep his sons in check.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney&#8217;s
opinion of
the
Munster
and
Connaught
gentry. He
advises a
President.</div>

<p>After spending nearly three months in Munster and Connaught,
Sidney came to the conclusion that they did not contain
the seeds of reformation within themselves. Ormonde
indeed did not lack ability; but he was absent, and likely to
be absent, and his work could not be done by deputy. He
summed up the qualifications of the other great lords in a few
pithy sentences. &#8216;The Earl of Desmond, a man both void
of judgment to govern and will to be ruled. The Earl of
Clancare I suppose willing enough to be ruled, but wanteth
force and credit to rule. The Earl of Thomond, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
imperfect of all the rest; hath neither wit of himself to
govern, nor grace or capacity to learn of others. The Earl of
Clanricarde, equal in all good parts with the best of his coat
of this country breed, both of good judgment to rule and
also of himself of great humbleness to obey your Majesty and
your laws, is yet so ruled by a putative wife, as oft times
when he best intendeth she forceth him to do worst.&#8217; It was
of small avail that the Lord Roche&#8217;s country in Cork was
pretty well managed, or that O&#8217;Shaughnessy, the son of him
whom Henry VIII. knighted, should be an exception among
the gentlemen of Galway. A President and Council for each
province had been long advocated by Sidney, who reiterated
his opinion that nothing else would be of any avail. He
condemned, with becoming indignation, what an important
public man had some years before called &#8216;the old and necessary
policy of keeping the Irish by all possible means at war
between themselves.&#8217; If this cowardly system of fostering
dissensions, lest quiet should bring unknown danger, were still
persisted in, then he begged the Queen to choose some other
minister. Ireland could only be reformed by justice, and by
making it possible to practise the arts of peace.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Randolph.
Fate of the
Derry
settlement.</div>

<p>After Randolph&#8217;s death the settlement at Derry went from
bad to worse. The encampment had been made over the
burying-ground, and the miasma did its work. The commissariat
officer was afraid to send his vessel away for fear of
weakening the garrison, every officer seeking a passage for his
friends. Discipline could hardly be maintained, and there
was great lack of necessaries. Storage room there was none,
and the enfeebled men were daily harassed by bringing supplies
from the ships. News seldom penetrated to that remote
spot, whither &#8216;no man travels by which men might have
some understanding before now. God send me, if it be His
will, once into England, and there to beg my bread if I be
not able to labour rather than here to be a lord.... I am
weary of my life, and all for want of the colonel.&#8217; Edward
Saintloo was sent to take Randolph&#8217;s place, and the mere fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of there being a man in authority worked wonders. &#8216;Before,
we were like godless people without a head or a guide.&#8217;
Saintloo brought some stores, but in bad order and partly
spoiled by one of the vessels taking ground in the bay.
&#8216;That which was saved hath come in an ill pickle, but yet are
we glad of it, for our meal was almost done and our mills not
able to grind so fast as we did eat. Sir, the provision of
meal is not like London, for it is coarse meal, and was never
bolted, but even as it came out of the mills, so packed into
great cakes.&#8217; Nothing could be bought but at exorbitant
rates, and the new colonel calculated that, out of their pay of
only 14<i>s.</i> a month, the men had to pay 10<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> for food, leaving
only 3<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> for clothing, wood, turf, bedding, straw, and
other necessaries. To obtain provisions, and perhaps to put
heart into his troops, he made a raid upon the O&#8217;Cahans, who
still adhered to Shane, and brought off vast numbers of cattle.
But the sickness continued, and soon there were but 200 able
men out of 600. It was decided to remove the garrison to
Coleraine or Strangford, but before measures could be taken
the settlement had ceased to exist. The sparks from the
forge, driven by a high wind, set fire to the magazine, which
had once been a church, or part of a church, and thirty men
were killed by the explosion. The survivors took what boats
they could find, and the majority made their way to Carrickfergus.
Some were driven ashore, and were hospitably treated
by Tirlogh Luineach O&#8217;Neill. The Queen, seeing that the
accident was by God&#8217;s ordinance, bore her loss well; but the
devout natives maintained that St. Columba had appeared in
the shape of a very large and particularly hairy wolf, that
he had taken a good mouthful of sparks out of the blacksmith&#8217;s
shop, and that he had then disgorged them into the
magazine.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The O&#8217;Donnells
totally
defeat
Shane,</div>

<p>The evacuation of Derry left the road into Tyrconnel once
more open, and Shane doubtless supposed that it was at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
mercy. He advanced with a large force to the ford over the
Swilly, now called Farsetmore, near Letterkenny. O&#8217;Donnell
was in the neighbourhood, and hastily sent messengers to
collect his friends. Sending the few horse at his disposal to
skirmish with Shane&#8217;s vanguard, he drew his men, who did
not exceed 400, into a strong position, and there addressed
them; telling his clansmen that death was far preferable to
the insults which they had of late years suffered at O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s
hands. They at once marched to attack Shane&#8217;s camp, and
found his men, who probably confided in their number, in a
state of unreadiness. A great slaughter followed, and the
O&#8217;Neills fled to the ford which they had crossed in the morning.
But it was now high water, and of those who escaped
the sword the greater number were drowned. Shane escaped
in the confusion, crossed the Swilly a little higher up, and
made his way into Tyrone. His loss was variously estimated
at 1,300, and at 3,000, and he never collected another army.
He at one time thought of appearing before Sidney with a
rope round his neck and begging for mercy. What he did
was to place himself in the power of the MacDonnells, of
whom a strong force had just landed at Cushendun, under
the command of Alexander Oge, who had come over at Sidney&#8217;s
request, and who remained in communication with him.
To him Shane now sent proposals for a permanent alliance
against the English.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">who is
killed by
the Scots.</div>

<p>Alexander agreed to a meeting, and Shane, accompanied
by the unfortunate countess, and by Sorley Boy, who was still
his prisoner, directed his steps towards Red Bay. His escort
was reduced to fifty horse. The Scots made a feast to welcome
their visitor, and after dinner Shane&#8217;s secretary was
accused of circulating the report that James MacDonnell&#8217;s
widow was about to marry the man who had killed her husband.
The secretary incautiously said that O&#8217;Neill was a
meet partner, not only for their chief&#8217;s wife, but for Mary of
Scotland, who was a widow at this time. Shane, who had
been indulging as usual in wine or whisky, came up at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
moment and took part in the altercation. The Scots drew their
dirks, and almost cut him to pieces. The body was thrown
into an old chapel hard by, and Captain Piers of Carrickfergus,
who had all along plotted for this conclusion, managed
to get possession of the head, which he sent, preserved in
salt, to Sidney. Piers received 1,000 marks, the reward
which Sidney had placed on the head, and the ghastly trophy
was stuck on a pole over the gate of Dublin Castle, where it
was seen by the historian Campion four years later. Shane&#8217;s
entire body had been valued at 1,000<i>l.</i>, 500<i>l.</i> being the sum
promised by proclamation for simply killing him. The trunk
was buried in the Franciscan monastery at Glenarm, and it
is said that monks from Armagh came afterwards to claim it.
&#8216;Have you,&#8217; said the prior, &#8216;brought with you the remains
of James MacDonnell, Lord of Antrim and Cantire, who was
buried among strangers at Armagh?&#8217; A negative answer was
given, and the prior said: &#8216;While you continue to tread on
the grave of James, Lord of Antrim and Cantire, know ye,
that we here in Glenarm will trample on the dust of your
great O&#8217;Neill.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of Shane
O&#8217;Neill.</div>

<p>&#8216;Shane the Proud,&#8217; as his countrymen called him, was
perhaps the ablest of Elizabeth&#8217;s Irish opponents. He intrigued
at different times with Spain, with France, and with
Scotland; but he received no foreign help. In practice he
regarded the Pope as lightly as the Queen, but he saw clearly
enough that it was his interest to pose as the Catholic champion.
The Pope, however, had not yet excommunicated the
Queen, nor was either France or Spain prepared to court the
hostility of England. Scottish politicians thought it worth
while to keep him in good humour, but mainly as a means
of increasing their own value with Elizabeth. Alone he bore
the brunt of the contest, and he must have cost the English
Crown a sum altogether out of proportion to his own resources.
Ware says that 3,500 soldiers were sacrificed in
this service, and that it cost the Queen more than 147,000<i>l.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
over and above all local imposts and all damage done to the
country. Shane was cruel and tyrannical, and his moral
character was as bad as possible, though not much worse than
that of Clanricarde, or perhaps of some other chiefs in that
rude age. He had an Oriental want of scruple about murdering
inconvenient people, and he had no regard for truth.
He is said to have been a glutton, and was certainly a
drunkard. We are told that he used to bury himself in the
ground to recover from his orgies, &#8216;by which means,&#8217; says the
chronicler, &#8216;though he became in some better plight for the
time, yet his manners and conditions daily worse.&#8217; The love
of liquor probably caused his death. By far the most remarkable
Irishman of his time, he cannot be regarded as in any
sense a national hero. His ambition was limited to making
himself supreme in Ulster. Had he been allowed to oppress
his own province, and perhaps to levy some blackmail beyond
its border, it is not likely that he would have troubled the
Pale, or denied the titular sovereignty of England. Being
such as he was, the vast majority of Irishmen probably rejoiced
at his fall, and the Irish annalists do not pretend that
he was much loss, except to his own tribe.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">No millennium
follows
Shane&#8217;s
death.</div>

<p>The Irish Council seem to have expected little less than
a millennium now that the arch-disturber was removed. The
Ulster chiefs hurried to make their submissions, and Tirlogh
Luineach, who had immediately assumed the name of O&#8217;Neill,
thought it wise to apologise for so doing. Tirlogh was willing
to pay for his own pardon as many kine as might be
awarded by Sidney and Kildare, to keep the peace for the
future, and to entertain no Scots without special licence.
Sir Brian MacPhelim, chief of Clandeboye, and the most important
O&#8217;Neill after Tirlogh, had served against Shane and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
received Elizabeth&#8217;s thanks, as did also O&#8217;Donnell. The
Council informed the Queen that all were now at her
foot, and cried &#8216;first for justice, and then for mercy.&#8217; But
the old Treasurer Winchester had seen too much in his time
to take a very sanguine view. The expense had been great,
and could not be continued indefinitely. &#8216;Irishmen,&#8217; he reminded
Sidney, &#8216;be full of policy, and wit, and mistrust, and
will soon alter themselves from the best, as you yourself
knoweth well.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney and
the Queen.</div>

<p>Elizabeth herself was not disposed to make light of
Shane&#8217;s overthrow and death. &#8216;We do very well,&#8217; her
Majesty wrote to Sidney, &#8216;allow your painful service and
good wisdom herein used, and are very glad, even for your
own sake, that God has used you under us as the principal
minister to procure so great and singular a benefit, as by the
permission of God&#8217;s favour is like hereby to ensue to that
whole realm. And in this, our allowing and praising of you,
we would have you well to note, that in reprehending you
for other things not allowable to us, we were not moved
thereto by any offence or misliking of yourself, but of the
matters. For, indeed, we otherwise think so well of you for
the faithfulness to us, and the painfulness in service, as yourself
could prescribe. And thus much we have thought not
impertinent to let you know how well we think of you for
this service done in Ulster.&#8217; Sidney, it seems, had heard
that the Queen intended to deprive him of the Presidency of
Wales, and had written angrily to say that in that case he
should resign the government of Ireland. Elizabeth had retorted
very tartly that the two offices were always held at
pleasure, and had never been in the same hands before, and
that she should do as she pleased, &#8216;and so also it is meet for
you to think and conform yourself.&#8217; The same letter contained
other sharp expressions, with an intimation that they
would have been sharper yet if Sidney&#8217;s &#8216;travayles had not
contrepassed.&#8217; Knowing the Deputy&#8217;s fiery temper, Cecil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
thought it wise to apply a salve, and the same packet which
brought the royal missive brought one from him. &#8216;The
Queen&#8217;s Majesty,&#8217; he wrote, &#8216;hath contrary to all our opinions
and requests that be your friends, written more roundly to
you than either I know you overmuch to deserve, or than I
trust she conceiveth in her mind. I can advise you to use
patience with the buckler of your sincerity, and I doubt not
but your service, succeeding so fortunately as it doth otherwise,
will bring you to your heart&#8217;s desire. In your service
all men of good judgment find great cause of allowance of
you, and before Almighty God with my whole heart I wish
myself with you to take part of good fortune. For I trust to
see your recovery of the crown in Ireland in deed, that is
only now had in title.&#8217; The fact is that it went to the
Queen&#8217;s frugal heart to see even her ablest servant holding
two great places at once. Afterwards, when Sidney
was at Court, she said that it was no wonder he made a
gallant show, for that he had two of the best offices in her
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney
dislikes
Ormonde.
Attempts
at maintaining
justice in
the South.</div>

<p>Elizabeth thought that Sidney leaned to Desmond&#8217;s side
in his controversy with Ormonde, and it is certain that he
was less favourable to the latter than her Majesty wished.
Ormonde distinctly belonged to the party opposed to Leicester,
and Sidney was Leicester&#8217;s brother-in-law. The Queen accordingly
accused him of culpable slackness in arresting
Desmond, and of proposing to confer the Presidency on Sir
Warham St. Leger, who had an hereditary feud with the
chief of the Butlers, and who scarcely concealed his partiality.
Desmond, on the contrary, after he had been two months
under restraint, complained bitterly that he had expected
better usage from Sidney, that he was a prisoner for no
reason, and that it would be grossly unjust to decide his
cause in his absence. His enemy, he added, had already
every advantage of favour and of education.</p>

<p>In the meantime efforts were made to extend the administration
of justice in the country districts. At Maryborough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
a jury was found to condemn a malefactor, who was executed.
At Carlow also the assizes passed over quietly. In Kilkenny
was found plenty of all but money, and such &#8216;strife for land&#8217;
that one acre was better than ten had been. The irregularity
of legal process may be gathered from the fact that Kilkenny
Castle contained many rogues and masterless men who had remained
apparently untried since the time of Edward VI., and
whom the judge of assize did not think it necessary to deliver
until the Lord Deputy&#8217;s pleasure should be known. Men of
family were treated differently; for one of the Fitzpatricks,
who had been tried and acquitted, being re-committed on a
new charge, was enlarged by the gaoler on his own responsibility.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

The Lord Treasurer declined to espouse his cause openly, but
privately informed Sidney that if he wished justice done he
must come to Court himself, and bring Desmond with him.
The Queen daily uttered sharp speeches against the Earl; and
Sidney alone, while his great services were fresh, could hope
to mollify her. Winchester advised a retinue of not more
than six men, to save expense and to avoid any appearance of
ostentation. For some time the Queen insisted that Desmond
should be arraigned, and, if possible, condemned in Ireland
before being sent over, but Sidney persuaded her to be satisfied
with having him indicted only. Fitzwilliam, who was a
strong partisan of Ormonde, wrote at the same time to complain
that Sir John of Desmond would not come near the
Judges of Assize, and that the Geraldines continued to spoil
the Butlers with impunity. The assizes in other places were
rather more successful. At Maryborough the abolition of
coyne and livery, imperfect as it was, was generally approved.
The poor people began for the first time to feel that they
had a worthy prince, and that they were subjects instead of
slaves. It was quaintly said that the people in their delight
&#8216;fell to such plays and pastimes as the like was never seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Ireland.&#8217; Lands long waste were again inhabited, rents had
trebled, the markets were thronged with dealers and produce.
&#8216;Up to this time,&#8217; said George Wyse of Waterford, &#8216;this poor
country had in manner no feeling of good order, neither knew
the poor fools God nor their prince, but as a "menye" of
brute beasts lived under the miserable rule of their ungodly
Irish lords. Now God be praised the world is otherwise
framed.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
much in
debt.</div>

<p>Shane being out of the way, it was possible for Sidney to
make some reduction in the military force, but not to do so
without money. The Queen owed 41,000<i>l.</i> in Ireland; 10,000<i>l.</i>
was grudgingly sent. After an interval 20,000<i>l.</i> more was got
together, Cecil pledging his own credit to Sir Thomas Gresham
for 7,000<i>l.</i> No sooner was this loan effected than the Queen
repented, but fortunately Winchester had despatched the
money, and it could not be recalled. Meanwhile fresh expenses
were incurred, and at the end of August, three months
after Shane&#8217;s death, 31,000<i>l.</i> were yet due to Sidney and
those under him. The Vice-Treasurer&#8217;s account had not been
balanced for years, 300,000<i>l.</i> still remaining on his books;
and Sidney appears to have borrowed between 2,000<i>l.</i> and
3,000<i>l.</i> to defray the most pressing calls. Frugality in a
sovereign is a virtue, but there can be no doubt that Elizabeth
carried it to excess.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney goes
to England,
1567.</div>

<p>Sidney went to England in the autumn of 1567, and left the
government in the hands of Lord Chancellor Weston and Sir
W. Fitzwilliam. The latter bemoaned his hard fate, and declared
that his last Lord Justiceship had cost him 2,000<i>l.</i>
Weston, a painstaking and conscientious man, thought that no
one but a soldier was fit to govern Ireland. What the sword
had won the sword must maintain, and it was nearly as hard
to keep men quiet as to make them so. At the approach of
winter the Irish were always ready to rebel. Munster had
been pretty quiet since the Lord Deputy&#8217;s visit in the spring,
and the terror of his name had for the time procured a hollow
and precarious peace. Six hundred soldiers, with some
cruisers, held down the North, but O&#8217;Donnell was not a steadfast
subject, and it was felt that the garrison was absolutely
necessary. Sir Brian MacPhelim was recommended to Elizabeth&#8217;s
favour &#8216;as the man that heretofore hath longest and
most constantly stayed on your Majesty&#8217;s party like a true
subject.&#8217; We shall see how his services were requited later
on. In Leinster the abolition, or rather suspension, of coyne
and livery had done wonders, though the Lords still oppressed
their own tenants, and thought the veteran brigand
Piers Grace was profiting by Shane&#8217;s absence to collect a new
band. Connaught was quiescent, but Clanricarde declared
that he was afraid to venture into England lest mischief
should arise in his absence.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

Award.
Desmond
and his
brother
sent to
London.</div>

<p>In spite of Desmond&#8217;s protestations, a royal commission
made an award while he was in restraint; his rival also being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
absent. The commissioners, among whom were the Master
of the Rolls, the Solicitor-General, and the Prime Serjeant,
declared that Desmond had damaged Ormonde to the extent
of 20,894<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, and that he ought to make good the
same. Before this crushing award could take effect an order
came from the Queen to send over Desmond and his brother
John; but the latter had refused to enter any walled town,
and, until he could be caught, the Lords Justices kept the
Earl in Dublin. Sir John then changed his tone, and said he
would go to England of his own accord; but weeks passed by
and the result seemed no nearer. The Lords Justices considered
that his disposition was unapt to bite at their bait.
They had almost given up hope, when the strong desire to
confer with his brother brought Sir John, who did not know
what was in store for him, on a voluntary visit to Dublin.
Fitzwilliam and Weston considered that he was &#8216;led by God
to accomplish her Majesty&#8217;s command.&#8217; Finding himself in
the power of the Government he made no resistance, though
objecting, not without reason, that Munster would be in a bad
way when he and his brother were both absent. There was a
difficulty about travelling expenses; for neither had a groat,
and Sir John offered to go back to his own country and raise
some money. But the Lords Justices avoided the net thus
spread in their sight, and sent over the brothers at the
Queen&#8217;s cost. The weather was very bad, and during a night
and a day at sea the Earl suffered so much from sickness that
Thomas Scott, who was in charge of the prisoners, thought it
advisable to land five miles from Beaumaris, at a point to
which the wind had driven the ship. So slender was the
provision made, that Scott had to borrow money here for
the journey southwards. A week later they were at Lichfield,
where Sir John fell sick, and made it necessary to halt.
Within three days from this they reached London penniless,
and the Queen, while directing that money should be raised
in Munster, indignantly remarked that it was Desmond&#8217;s
custom to have none, and to borrow from her.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>When Sidney had been some months in England, Cecil
drew up an elaborate scheme for the future government of
Ireland, which may probably be taken as embodying the joint
opinions of these two great men. It is interesting to test their
value by the light of subsequent events, but it must not be
forgotten that neither Sidney nor Cecil had often their own
way for long. The Queen habitually deferred to her Ministers,
but when unwilling to do this, she always had her own way,
and circumstances, which even the strongest cannot always
control, will modify the wisest policy. That Cecil understood
the question well will hardly be disputed by those who study
the document now under consideration. He proposed that a
Parliament should be held without delay, which should declare
the Crown entitled to Ulster, and provide for its division into
shires, after a survey had been made. The great object was to
prevent a new local tyranny from being established. Civilised
men should be encouraged to settle in the North, especially
those of Irish birth, &#8216;for it is supposed that they may better
maintain their habitation with less charge than such Englishmen
as are mere strangers to the land.&#8217; No tenant was to be
subject to rent except on condition of full protection. A
residence for the Deputy should be provided at Armagh,
and in his absence a soldier of rank, if possible the Vice-Treasurer,
Marshal, or Master of the Ordnance, was to fill his
place, and to govern with the help of a permanent council.
It was hoped that the levies which O&#8217;Neill formerly commanded
might be made available for her Majesty&#8217;s service.
To hold the country there were to be forts at Fathom, near
Newry, at Castleblayney, at a bridge to be thrown over the
Blackwater between Armagh and Lough Neagh, at a point
on the shore of the great lake, and at Toome, near the
efflux of the Ban. At Coleraine there was to be a fortified
bridge. The coast of Antrim was to be guarded against
the Scots by forts at Portrush and at some point between
Fair Head and Larne. In the work of protecting Belfast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Lough Carrickfergus was to have the help of a strong post at
Bangor. Belfast itself, and a fort at Massareene Abbey, on the
eastern shore of Lough Neagh, were to complete the chain.
Besides the bridges at Coleraine and Blackwater, it was
proposed to throw one over the Erne at Ballyshannon and
another over the Foyle at Lifford. Munster was to have
a President and Council resident at Dungarvan, the parsonage
of which, by a singular provision, was to be attached to the
Presidency. A similar government for Connaught was to be
placed at Athlone; Galway, Roscommon, and Balla being
named as assize towns. Tyrconnel is treated as in some
degree separate both from Connaught and from Ulster;
O&#8217;Connor Sligo being freed from all subjection to O&#8217;Donnell,
in consideration of his voluntary submission to the Queen,
and on condition of his accepting of an estate of inheritance.
To bind O&#8217;Connor faster, he was allowed to preserve the
friary at Sligo, in which his ancestors were buried, substituting
secular canons for Dominicans, a condition which
was probably never fulfilled. O&#8217;Donnell thought all this very
hard measure, observing that no O&#8217;Connor had ever served
the Crown but by compulsion of his own ancestors. The lands
adjoining castles in charge of constables were not to be farmed
out, but kept always in hand for their support. Such was
Cecil&#8217;s scheme after the fullest conference with Sidney, and,
if we except that matter of Dungarvan parsonage, we must
acknowledge that it shows a pretty accurate appreciation of
the Irish problem.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
O&#8217;Neills
and
O&#8217;Donnells,
and the
Scots.</div>

<p>The memory of Sidney&#8217;s prowess and the dread of his
return kept down for a time the turbulent elements of Ulster.
But every day showed that though Shane was gone, the conditions
that had made him formidable were little altered.
There were ominous signs of an alliance between Tirlogh
Luineach and O&#8217;Donnell, who divided the customs of Lough
Foyle and the rent of Innishowen between them. Tirlogh
still continued his relations with the Scots, and, after his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
predecessor&#8217;s example, proposed various marriages for himself,
in which he showed a fine contempt for national and other
prejudices. James MacDonnell&#8217;s widow or her daughter, one
of the O&#8217;Neills, and Sir Nicholas Bagenal&#8217;s sister-in-law, were
among the ladies thus honoured. Bagenal declared that he
would rather see his kinswoman burned, though she was
promised twenty English men and six English gentlewomen
to wait upon her. Tirlogh may not have known this, and
perhaps he may have thought Bagenal&#8217;s alliance as valuable
as that of the Scots, or he may merely have been gratifying
an innate love of telling lies. He refused a hat set in bugles
which Argyle sent him, declaring in the presence of the
Marshal&#8217;s messenger that he had already received a hat from
Lady Bagenal which he valued more than all the hats in
Scotland. But he was on the best terms with Sorley Boy,
who had sworn not to leave Ireland if he could help it.
Tirlogh told the Government that he wanted nothing with
Argyle but to make him attack the MacDonnells, but he kept
130 Campbells about him; whom he professed to entertain
only because they were hostile to the clans who had claims to
land in Ireland. He said he would have no mercenaries if
only Sir Brian MacPhelim and Art MacBaron would obey
him. This was to beg the whole question, but the marriage
of his daughter seems to show that he really meant hostility
to the MacDonnells.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Strength of
the Scots. Weakness
of the Government.</div>

<p>The politics of the Western Highlands at this time are very
obscure. It is hard to distinguish between what Argyle did
for his own aggrandisement and what he did with really
national objects. At Tutbury, a year later, Mary was almost
directly charged with causing disaffection in Ireland through
Argyle&#8217;s agency, and she remained silent, which, however,
does not prove much. It was obviously for the interest both
of the Scottish Crown and of the House of Argyle that Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Elizabeth should have her hands full in the North of Ireland.
Perhaps, after all, Scotch intrigues did less mischief than
official quarrels. Piers and Maltby at Carrickfergus pleaded
that they had neither ships nor men to guard thirty miles
of coast night and day. Tirlogh Luineach had sent to Sir
Brian MacPhelim to say that the Queen had determined to
root out the O&#8217;Neills, whose only chance was to join the
Scots. Sir Brian told this to the English officers, protesting
his loyalty, but showing no great eagerness to supply them
with beef. The soldiers suffered from dysentery and ague,
and sometimes from delirious fever, and Piers and Maltby
could only temporise. Against the Scots they could do
nothing&mdash;against the Irish they were not allowed to do anything
for fear of quenching the smoking flax. The Lords
Justices took no further notice of their complaints than to
taunt them for lying within walls instead of in the open fields.
Taking little heed of differences among servants Elizabeth, in
her queenly way, marvelled that the Scots were suffered to
land, and that having landed they were not straightway
expelled. If Piers was too weak Fitzwilliam might do it
himself. Before her orders arrived, the two captains at
Carrickfergus had made a peace with Tirlogh for four months.
Both the Lord Justice and his sovereign began to think this
new O&#8217;Neill as bad as the old one, who, to do him justice,
had never encouraged Scots. It was now proposed to send
over the young Baron of Dungannon, whose English education
might be supposed to have given him a love of order. Hugh
O&#8217;Neill had indeed studied the strength and the weakness of
England at head-quarters, and he was consequently destined
to be more formidable than any of his predecessors had been.
As to Fitzwilliam, he complained bitterly and with very good
reason that the unpunished landing of the Scots was no fault
of his. He had not been bred up to arms, and why should
he be expected to do better than noblemen of great ability
and military knowledge, who had failed still more conspicuously?
During more than eight years&#8217; banishment he had
served the Queen in hated Ireland without bribery or robbery.
The burden of the Treasurer&#8217;s office weighed him to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">Massacre at
Mullaghmast.
Perhaps
in 1567.</div>

<p>Under the year 1567 may perhaps be placed the massacre
at Mullaghmast, near Athy, where Cosby and Hartpole, assisted
by many English and Irish, of whom the majority
were Catholics, slaughtered certain of the O&#8217;Mores who had
been summoned on pretence of being required for service. The
defence offered by an annotator of the annalist Dowling is
that &#8216;Hartpole excused it that Moris O&#8217;More had given villainous
words to the breach of his protection.&#8217; The received
story is that the O&#8217;Mores were first enticed into the fort, and
there, as the &#8216;Four Masters&#8217; put it, &#8216;surrounded on every side
by four lines of soldiers and cavalry, who proceeded to shoot
and slaughter them without mercy, so that not a single individual
escaped by flight or force.&#8217; Dowling, who is followed
by the &#8216;Four Masters&#8217; in giving the date 1577, has been thought
the earliest writer to mention this massacre; but the Irish
chronicle, now called the &#8216;Annals of Lough Cé,&#8217; is more strictly
contemporary, and places it under 1567. Dowling, as appears
from internal evidence, wrote in or after the year 1600, when
Sir George Carew was Lord President of Munster. He was
only twenty-three in 1567, while Brian MacDermot, under
whose auspices the &#8216;Annals of Lough Cé&#8217; were indisputably
compiled, was certainly taking an interest in the book as early
as 1580. Yet Dowling was Chancellor of Leighlin, little more
than twenty miles from Mullaghmast, while MacDermot and the
poor scholars whom he employed lived in distant Connaught.
Dowling&#8217;s dates are often wrong, but perhaps his authority is
the best for the circumstances, while the others may be right
as to the year. The former says forty were killed, the latter
seventy-four. Philip O&#8217;Sullivan, who published his &#8216;Catholic
History&#8217; in 1621, makes the number of victims 180, and Dr.
Curry, apparently without contemporary authority, calmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
raises it to some hundreds. Traditional accounts say the
families of Cosby, Piggott, Bowers, Hartpole, Fitzgerald, and
Dempsey, of whom the last five were Catholic, were engaged
in the massacre; but that little blame attaches in popular
estimation to any but the last, who alone were of Celtic race
and whose insignificance in later times has been considered
a judgment. For us it may suffice to say, with the Lough Cé
annalists, &#8216;that no uglier deed than that was ever committed
in Erin.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Munster
disturbed
in Desmond&#8217;s
absence.</div>

<p>As soon as Desmond and his brother were gone fresh
troubles sprung up in Munster. Lady Desmond reported
that the county was so impoverished by rapine and by the
irregular exactions of the Earl&#8217;s people, that it was impossible
to raise even the smallest sum for her husband&#8217;s necessities.
No one was safe, and she herself was continually on the move,
trying to &#8216;appease the foolish fury of their lewd attempts.&#8217;
The Earl&#8217;s cousin, James Fitzmaurice, and Thomas Roe, his
illegitimate brother, were competitors for the leadership.
Fitzmaurice claimed to have been appointed by Desmond,
though no writing could be produced, and both the Countess
and the Commissioners thought him the fittest person. But
the Lords Justices ordered the lady to govern with the Bishop
of Limerick&#8217;s help.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James Fitzmaurice.</div>

<p>Fitzmaurice and Thomas Roe were apprehended in their
name, but released on the arrival of a commission to the
former under the seals of the Earl and Sir John. The country
people would not allow him to go before the Commissioners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
saying that Desmond and his brother were hostages enough.
Thomas Roe was released on Lords Roche and Power giving
their word for him. Fitzmaurice kept very quiet for some
time, waiting until he saw how his cousin&#8217;s affairs sped in
London.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Little can
be done in
Sidney&#8217;s
absence.</div>

<p>In the meantime there was little peace in the North,
though the truce with the Scots gave some breathing time.
The well affected, wrote Maltby, gaped for Sidney&#8217;s return;
the ill affected were ready to break out if once assured that he
would return no more. While the coast lay open to the invader,
the Queen&#8217;s troops languished in poverty and sickness,
their horses died for want of provender, and Maltby complained
that he had to feed the men at the cost of his own carcass.
Lord Louth and his fellow-commissioners kept pouring water
into the sieve, but they had neither power nor authority to
cure abuses. They gave no satisfaction to the natives, and
Tirlogh Luineach steadily declined to come near them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Starving
soldiers.</div>

<p>Captain Cheston, who held the post at Glenarm, said his
men were faint from want of food. Four pairs of querns in
the church were the only means of converting raw corn into
meal. There were no women to work them, and the men
said they had no skill in grinding. The necessary repairs to
the church were done at the captain&#8217;s own expense. It was
dangerous to venture alone even a short way afield; but the
monotony of garrison life was occasionally varied by a little
cattle driving, which had no tendency to impress the advantages
of civilisation on the Celtic barbarians. It had been
decided that Tirlogh Luineach should marry James MacDonnell&#8217;s
widow, and that O&#8217;Donnell, who was a somewhat
younger man, should have the daughter. Captain Thornton
with his cruiser failed to intercept the ladies, but succeeded
for a time in delaying the weddings. In Maltby&#8217;s opinion it
needed only to fortify the coast, and the conquest of the wicked
Irish nation would be but a summer&#8217;s work. The long period
during which Tirlogh Luineach was obliged to pay his Scots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
impoverished him greatly, and his plundering expeditions
among the neighbours were not very successful, but it was
Sir Brian MacPhelim and not the English captains who really
kept him in check.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Miserable
state of the
North.</div>

<p>Fitzwilliam had blamed Piers and Maltby for not lying in
the fields during the winter, but in spite of the Queen&#8217;s order
he delayed his own journey to Ulster till the end of March.
Tirlogh Luineach, who could not repress his pride of race,
took the highest possible ground, styling himself prince, and
declaring that he had only chastised those who were his own
subjects. He expected soon to be at the head of 3,000 or
4,000 men, and the English companies were very weak.
Fitzwilliam found he could trust no nominal muster, and resolved
to count heads himself. A general hosting would be
necessary, but for this it would be wiser to wait till Sidney
came. So miserable were the arrangements that Fitzwilliam
had to leave Carrickfergus for want of victuals. To hasten
his departure he was told that his life was in danger, and the
monstrous suggestion was made that Maltby, than whom the
Queen had no better officer, was in the plot. And thus the
early summer passed away, the Lord Justice suffering from
dysentery, the soldiers half starving, the captains afraid to
trust each other, and the Irish killing and plundering as if
there had been no Queen in England. The chiefs who had
hitherto remained faithful still protested their loyalty, but
fled before Fitzwilliam, in the belief that he had come to spoil
them. The local Commissioners had denied that he was
coming. Finding themselves deceived, they had been forced
to make a precipitous retreat in order to place their cattle in
safety. The approach of the Governor was a signal for loyal
subjects to conceal their property.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

Weston
and Sutton.</div>

<p>The general course of government during Sidney&#8217;s absence
was not much more successful than that of the outlying provinces.
The chief weight of it, especially when Fitzwilliam
was in the North, fell upon the Lord Chancellor, an excellent
man, and universally respected. His fee of 100<i>l.</i> was, as
Cecil confessed, notoriously insufficient, and he was expected
to eke it out by the revenues of the Deanery of St. Patrick&#8217;s.
His conscience rebelled against this, for no one knew better
how little religion and education could afford to lose any part
of their endowment. &#8216;Attend at least,&#8217; he besought Cecil,
&#8216;to the perfectly obedient districts, the less they feel their
degradation the more it moveth me to bewail and to name
some remedy.&#8217; The Archbishop of Dublin had made some
stir, but as yet any fruits of the reformation were confined to
his cathedrals. Financial matters were in no better case.
Vice-Treasurer Fitzwilliam&#8217;s accounts had not been audited
for more than nine years, and the unchecked balance amounted
to near 400,000<i>l.</i> The soldiers&#8217; pay was in arrears, and means
were wanting to pay even the most pressing creditors. The
ignorance of the common and statute law was as great as that
of the Gospel. The old complaints of family alliances among
the lawyers were repeated. When we consider that there were
no published Acts of Parliament, it is easy to understand how
great may have been the power of this privileged class. It
was said, and probably with truth, that the Irish nobility
often had the judges practically in their pay; and there was
little justice to be had by the Crown on the one hand, or by
the poor subjects on the other.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
in London.
Examination
of
Irish
witnesses.</div>

<p>It does not appear whether Desmond was committed to
the Tower on his arrival in London; but he found himself in
close confinement there within six weeks, and complained that
he was not treated as became his rank. The Queen may have
felt doubts about his promise of repayment being fulfilled,
but there were better reasons than that for treating him
somewhat sternly. Two sons of old O&#8217;Connor Faly, who had
given so much trouble in past reigns, had been some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
prisoners in London. Both were proclaimed traitors, and
both admitted that the Earl had harboured them and others
in the same legal position. The sworn examination of Cahir
throws so much light on the way of life in Ireland that it
may well be given entire:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;He saith that understanding his brother Cormac to be
with the Earl of Desmond, he came into the said Earl&#8217;s
country to Adare. There he met a boy of his said brother&#8217;s
who told him he was departed that morning and followed
Lysaght MacMorogh O&#8217;Connor and his company, with a guide
of the Earl&#8217;s appointment. Said Cahir forthwith followed,
and about four or five miles from Adare met Lysaght and
the Earl&#8217;s man, and the next morning met his brother Cormac.
They all continued with the Earl&#8217;s man for a fortnight,
resorting to every place within a certain precinct of the country
for that time to eat and drink. The names of the places
where they were so entertained he remembereth as ensueth.
First, from the place where they met they went to a town
wherein there is a castle called Ballyvolane, where dwelleth
one of the said Desmond&#8217;s household, and there they continued
two nights. Thence they went to MacAulliffe&#8217;s castle,
where they remained two days, and from thence, by appointment
of the said Earl&#8217;s man, they came to Drishane castle,
and there continued one night. Thence they went to Pobble
O&#8217;Keefe, and there continued one night, and thence to MacDonogh&#8217;s
country, where they stayed two days. Thence they
went to the old prior O&#8217;Callaghan&#8217;s, where they rested one
night. And for that the time was expected which was assigned
and appointed by the Earl to his man and the said
Lysaght to resort to those places as aforesaid, and that the
said man, called Teig MacDonnell, durst not resort with them
to any place before he had further instructions as commanded
from the said Earl, and for that the said Lysaght was the said
Earl&#8217;s near kinsman, they thought good to send him, with
another of their company called Shane O&#8217;Moony, to the said
Earl&#8217;s being at Connigse, Shane MacCragh&#8217;s house, to obtain
of the said Earl further instructions and licence to spend on
the country by way of coyne or other succour. So after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
said Lysaght departed, the said Cormac and Cahir, with the
residue of their said company, went to a castle called Carrignavar,
where they remained a night. Next morning they
went to a place where they and the said Lysaght O&#8217;Connor
did appoint to meet at his return from the said Earl, at which
place they met the said Shane O&#8217;Moony. But the said Lysaght
stayed with the said Earl, and the said Shane then told
them that the Earl&#8217;s pleasure was that Cormac and Cahir
should go with the foresaid Teige MacDonnell, the said Earl&#8217;s
man, to Donogh MacCarthy, and there to remain until after
his return from Waterford; and said further that the said
Earl of Desmond willed him to tell the said Cormac and
Cahir that, if at Waterford he did agree with the Governor
he would be a mean for them; and then willed the residue of
the said company to resort unto him to attend with the said
Lysaght MacMorogh, or the said Desmond. And so they
continued with the said Earl until he went into Sir Maurice
Fitzgerald&#8217;s country, where then, at the conflict between the
Earls of Ormonde and Desmond, the said Lysaght MacMorogh
O&#8217;Connor was slain. Art O&#8217;Connor, brother to Gerot MacShane,
was killed also. Connor MacCormac O&#8217;Connor was
hurt and escaped, and divers others slain. During which
time the said Cormac and Cahir continued at Donogh MacCarthy&#8217;s
aforesaid, as they were willed to do until such time as
they heard of the overthrow given to the said Earl of Desmond,
and then they departed the said Donogh MacCarthy&#8217;s house
and also gave over the said Earl&#8217;s man. Thence they went
to MacCarthy More&#8217;s country, where Cahir departed from his
brother Cormac and returned to O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s country, the said
Cahir having occasion there to speak with some of his kindred.
And from thence the said Cahir followed his brother
Cormac to O&#8217;Connor Kerry&#8217;s country, where it was told Cahir
by O&#8217;Connor Kerry that his said brother Cormac was departed
towards John of Desmond. Two nights after Cahir, in company
with Teige MacMorogh, the chiefest of the proclaimed
traitors of the O&#8217;Briens, went from the said O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s house
to John of Desmond to meet his said brother Cormac, which
was then, as he learned, gone to Thomond. Afterwards he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
returned to the Earl of Desmond&#8217;s country, and at Askeaton
the said Cahir sent one Teige Roe O&#8217;Meagher, then attendant
about the said John, to the said John to show him the said
Cahir&#8217;s brother was gone to Thomond, and that the said Cahir
was willing and desirous to tarry in Sir John&#8217;s company until
his brother returned from Thomond, which would not be
for a sevennight. The said Sir John sent word by Teige
O&#8217;Meagher that Cahir was welcome, and willed him to continue
in his company and keep his name secret and private.
The said Cahir willed the messenger to tell Sir John that he
named himself by a contrary name, that is to say, MacQuillin&#8217;s
son of the Route, who was banished by the Scots. And so in
the said Sir John&#8217;s company he continued for a week or thereabouts,
and for that the said Cormac came not, the foresaid
Cahir followed him into Thomond.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond&#8217;s
own case.</div>

<p>Desmond did not deny that he had given meat and drink
to some proclaimed traitors, but pleaded that Irish hospitality
could scarcely do less, and that he had never helped them to
do any harm. He maintained stiffly that he had authority to
rule all Munster Geraldines, and to decide their causes without
any regard to sheriffs. Sir Maurice Fitzgerald, evidence
of whose tenure from the Crown was recorded in the Exchequer,
protested energetically against this theory. A long
list of outrages in Munster was charged against the Earl,
and mention was made of a little friar who had been a messenger
between him and the O&#8217;Neills, and who had been
found begging in their camp after Shane&#8217;s death. Finding
that the case was likely to go against them, and feeling that
they were in the lion&#8217;s mouth, the Earl and his brother
thought it wise to make a general surrender of all their lands
into her Majesty&#8217;s hands; and Desmond even brought himself
to beg that she would place a President and Council in
Munster. So far as law went, Elizabeth now had Munster at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
her mercy, but she kept fast hold on her prisoners until time
should declare how far the law coincided with the facts.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare.
Oliver
Sutton.</div>

<p>The leader of the Northern Geraldines, who had, perhaps,
no fancy either for the Tower or for a renewed exile, had his
accusers at this time, and later events tend to prove that
they were not without justification. In 1534 it had been
David Sutton, a Kildare gentleman of ancient race, who had
led the attack on the ninth Earl of Kildare, and laid bare the
many abuses of his rule. &#8216;The office of belling the cat,&#8217;
says a modern writer, &#8216;descended hereditarily to Oliver
Sutton,&#8217; who attacked his grandson and namesake. In 1565
he presented to the Queen articles containing matters of the
gravest importance against Kildare. He had previously complained
to Arnold, but that despotic proconsul was submissive
to the Earl, and imprisoned the unfortunate reformer for sixteen
weeks. In fear of his life, Sutton was obliged to quit his
lands and to hide from the local tyrant&#8217;s rage in Dublin or
England. Arnold was confessedly a reformer himself, and,
except from partiality to Kildare, it is hard to see why he
treated Sutton so harshly, while listening with excessive
credulity to all Bermingham&#8217;s representations. Coyne and
livery in their most oppressive forms and every kindred exaction
were charged against the Earl. The bastard Geraldines
and Keatings were supported by him, even when openly resisting
the Queen&#8217;s troops. They boasted that the Earl, and
not the English power, really defended the country, and that
there would be no quiet until he became chief Governor.
Pride of blood made them wish to enslave all others, and
&#8216;the daily exclamations of the poor were right sorrowful to
hear.&#8217; The Queen, having heard Sutton herself and read his
reports, sent him back to Ireland, of which Sidney had assumed
the government, observing that they touched Kildare too
directly, and that she was loth to believe evil of her cousin
until it could be proved. Yet she was evidently strongly impressed,
and gave orders for Sutton&#8217;s personal protection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
The inquiry dragged on for more than two years, Sutton
reiterating his charges and Kildare thwarting him in various
ways. The Earl&#8217;s service, he said, had all been at the Queen&#8217;s
expense, for he received the pay of 300 men, which he made
the country support. Jobbing was universal, and no one was
more concerned in maintaining the system than Kildare. Yet
Sutton&#8217;s heart began to sink: he complained that he was too
poor to strive with the powerful Earl, and that all his exertions
had but served to excite his vengeance. He probably
failed to prove his whole case, but Sidney was directed to
make particular inquiry, and not to discourage Sutton. Yet
he too was evidently prejudiced in the Earl&#8217;s favour, and
recommended him for a garter. In this he relied on the
authority of Henry VII., &#8216;who made his grandfather knight
and wist full well what he did&#8217;&mdash;an ominous precedent and
an argument unworthy of Sidney. Cecil evidently believed
in Sutton, and begged Sidney to befriend him, even if in
some degree deserving of blame. That he was not altogether
ruined is shown by his appearance in 1571 as plaintiff in a
successful Chancery suit; but he failed in making any serious
impression on Kildare&#8217;s position.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Peter
Carew.</div>

<p>It was at this critical period that the English Government
thought fit to allow an enterprise, the success of which
was enough to make the great mass of Irish and Anglo-Irish
landlords shake in their shoes. The adventurer was Sir Peter
Carew, of Mohuns Ottery in Devon, who, at the age of fifty-four,
set himself a task more arduous than any which had yet
occupied his stormy and eventful life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His early
life.</div>

<p>In his case it was more than commonly true that the boy
was the father of the man. When only twelve the citizen of
Exeter, with whom he lodged, pursued him during one of his
many absences from school, and found him on the city walls.
&#8216;Running to take him, the boy climbed upon the top of one of
the highest garrets of a turret of the said wall, and would not
for any request come down, saying, moreover, to his host
that if he did press too fast upon him he would surely cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
himself down headlong over the wall, "and then," saith he,
"I shall break my neck, and thou shalt be hanged because
thou makest me to leap down."&#8217; His father was sent for,
and ordered the boy to be led home in a leash. Afterwards
he coupled him for some time to a hound. Further endeavours
failed to make &#8216;young Peter to smell to a book, or to
like of any schooling,&#8217; and he was allowed to accompany a
friend who had a post about the embassy at Paris, and who
neglected him shamefully. He afterwards lived as a horse-boy
in a French nobleman&#8217;s train, without any inquiry being
made by his affectionate parents. While yet a boy he fought
at the siege of Pavia, changed sides opportunely, and served
Philibert of Orange till that prince&#8217;s death. The Princess, after
a time, gave him a letter of recommendation to Henry VIII.
&#8216;The young gentleman,&#8217; says his biographer, &#8216;... rode
to Mohuns Ottery, where his father dwelled, and understanding
his father and mother to be within, went into the house
without further delay, and finding them sitting together in a
parlour, forthwith in most humble manner kneeled before
them and asked their blessing, and therewith presented the
Princess of Orange&#8217;s letters.... They were much astounded,
... but Sir William having read the Princess&#8217;s letters, and
being persuaded that he was his son Peter, were not a little
joyful, but received him with all gladness, and also welcomed
the gentlemen, whom he and his wife entertained in the best
manner they could.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">His adventures.</div>

<p>After this Carew was employed on every kind of service,
in Scotland, Turkey, Italy, Flanders, France; his admirable
mastery of the French language and his skill on horseback
with the sword and with the lance making him everywhere
remarkable. Henry VIII. helped him to a rich wife, but died
before the marriage, which was celebrated on Edward VI.&#8217;s
coronation day, when the bridegroom, as one of the six
challengers, &#8216;like Ulysses in honour of his Penelope, wore
her sleeve upon his head-piece, and acquitted himself very
honourably.&#8217; Like Ulysses, too, when he had gained his
Penelope, Carew &#8216;could not rest from travel.&#8217; He helped to
put down the anti-Protestant rising in the West, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
King&#8217;s death hastened to proclaim his Catholic sister. But
life, either at Mohuns Ottery or at his wife&#8217;s place in Lincolnshire,
was too safe and too dull for the old campaigner. He
became involved in Wyatt&#8217;s conspiracy, and had to fly to
Antwerp, where he was seized by Philip&#8217;s myrmidons, and

<div class="sidenote">Carew in
favour with
Elizabeth.</div>

<p>At Elizabeth&#8217;s accession Carew was received into favour,
but that peculiar Court did not suit his humour, and he
offended Gloriana by joining the ranks of those who urged
her to marry. Her resentment was not very long or deep, and
she &#8216;gave him very good things, which were as liberally, if
not wastefully, consumed.&#8217; In 1560 he was sent on a confidential
mission to Scotland, where the dissensions of Norfolk
and Grey, and her Majesty&#8217;s own double dealing, threatened
disaster to the English arms. Fearing to trust anyone, he
was obliged to write his own letters with a hand more used
to the sword than the pen. On his return Elizabeth acknowledged
his good service, and &#8216;being somewhat pleasant
with him, thanked him for his letters of his own penning,
commending him to be a very good secretary, for indeed he
wrote them with no more pain than she had labour to read
them, for as he spent a night in writing, so she spent a whole
night in reading.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Carew&#8217;s
claims to
property in
Ireland.</div>

<p>A country life can seldom satisfy a man of action, even
though he be reckoned &#8216;the wisest justice on the banks of
Trent,&#8217; and Carew found it very dull in Devonshire. To beguile
the time, and having some vague inkling of castles in
Ireland, he ransacked the archives at Mohuns Ottery, and
found many parchments which he was unable to read. His
curiosity increasing daily, he sought the aid of John Hooker,
Chamberlain of Exeter, who loved records as much as Mr.
Welbore Ellis loved Blue-books. This eminent antiquary
had for his nephew the famous Richard Hooker, and to his
learned uncle the great author of the &#8216;Ecclesiastical Polity&#8217;
owed his University education and the patronage of Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Jewell. To Hooker&#8217;s eye the value of Carew&#8217;s parchments
was at once apparent, and he succeeded in making a fair transcript,
though the oldest document had been trodden under
foot and nearly obliterated. Sir Peter, being satisfied of his
descent from men who had held great possessions in Ireland,
went to the Queen and asked leave to recover his own. This
was but too readily granted, and orders were sent from her
Majesty in Council requiring the help of all royal officers in
Ireland. Hooker was straightway despatched thither, and
his arrival caused a commotion which might have disheartened
anyone less determined than his employer. He obtained
leave to search the Dublin archives, and proved to his own
satisfaction that Sir Peter was entitled to the Barony of
Idrone in Leinster, to certain great seignories in Munster,
and to Duleek and other manors in Meath, &#8216;and that nothing
could be found to prejudice or impeach his title, but only
prescription, which in that land holdeth not.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A prescription
of 170
years
against
Carew.</div>

<p>Sir Peter claimed a vast inheritance in Munster as heir
to the conqueror Robert FitzStephen, whose only daughter
was supposed to have married a Carew. Unfortunately for
this theory Giraldus twice states in the plainest language
that FitzStephen had no legitimate offspring, and it is hard
to see how his testimony can possibly be shaken on such
a point. Carew may perhaps have married his natural
daughter, but that would give him no title at all under the
grant of Henry II.; and his claims over the vast region between
Lismore and St. Brandon&#8217;s Head in Kerry may therefore
be dismissed. That the Carews did, however, by some
means become possessed of much land in Munster is none
the less clear. There was a Marquis Carew who, at some
period before the accession of Henry IV., had a revenue of
2,200<i>l.</i> in the county of Cork, besides the possession and
profits of Dursey and other havens there. The Carews seem
to have left Ireland altogether in the time of Richard II., so
that in any case there was a prescription of 170 years against
Sir Peter. The English heralds manufactured a pedigree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
for him &#8216;in colours very orderly,&#8217; bringing down his title from
FitzStephen&#8217;s mythical daughter: and had not political considerations
stood in the way, it is probable that his title would
have been admitted by the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Carew
comes to
Ireland
and claims
Idrone.</div>

<p>Hooker took a house in Dublin for his principal, and
warned him that most things would have to be brought from
England, and that it was difficult to raise even 20<i>l.</i> in the
Irish capital. The raw material of good housekeeping&mdash;fish,
flesh, and fowl&mdash;was to be had; but sugar and spices, a
steward, a cook, a physician, and a surgeon, would all have
to be imported. These preparations being at last completed,
Carew set sail from Ilfracombe, and landed at Waterford,
whither Hooker lost no time in repairing. Thither also
came two other men of Devon, Thomas Stukeley, at this
time Constable of Leighlin, the stormy petrel of Elizabeth&#8217;s
time, and Henry Davells, afterwards the victim of a frightful
tragedy. Both professed themselves anxious to help their
countryman in his attempt to recover the Barony of Idrone
in Carlow, which had formerly belonged to his family, and
which Hooker had already inspected. Davells and Stukeley
accompanied Carew to Leighlin, where the latter entertained
him, and where he received several chiefmen of the Kavanaghs,
which clan had been in possession of Idrone since
Richard II.&#8217;s day at least. Sir Peter informed them that he
was their lord, and was come to claim his own, &#8216;which
speeches were not so hard unto them but they more hardly
digested them.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Council
allow
Carew&#8217;s
claim in the
Cheevers
case.</div>

<p>Having so far advanced his claim to Idrone, Carew repaired
to Dublin, where he kept open house pending Sidney&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
arrival. His claim was naturally the general subject of conversation,
and an old lady professed to see in his coming the
fulfilment of a prophecy that the dead should rise again.
He decided to make his first serious attack in Meath upon
the manor of Maston, held by Sir Christopher Cheevers, a
gentleman of old family, and connected with the principal
people of the Pale and the principal lawyers in Dublin. But
one Irish barrister could be got to take his brief, and it
seems that he afterwards threw it up, for an Exeter man,
William Peryam, of the Middle Temple, afterwards Chief
Baron, was brought over specially for the occasion. A Bill
was filed before the Lord Deputy and Council, but the common
lawyers retained by Cheevers advised that the suit could
not be maintained there. Peryam rested his case on naked
prerogative, and the two Chief Justices gave a private
opinion in his favour, on the ground that Carew could have
no fair trial at law. Sir Christopher had no chance of a fair
trial before the Council, and was therefore fain to compromise
the case. The weight of documentary evidence, a prescription
of at least 170 years being allowed no weight at all,
seems to have been on Sir Peter&#8217;s side, and Cheevers offered
him eighteen years&#8217; purchase for the lands in dispute. Carew
voluntarily offered them for fifteen, and he did not insist even
on this. Cheevers seems to have worked on his generosity
by talking of his wife and children, and in the end had &#8216;the
whole land released unto him almost for nothing, saving a
drinking nut of silver worth about 20<i>l.</i>, and three or four
horses worth about 30<i>l.</i>&#8217; Carew&#8217;s adventurous nature may
have been satisfied with the honours of war, or he may have
thought it good policy to make friends in Dublin before
embarking on the greater undertakings which he had in
view.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Carew is
adjudged
entitled to
Idrone.</div>

<p>The ruling in the Cheevers case governed the others, and,
Sidney having returned to his government, the Council assumed
the power of dealing with Idrone. Three of the
Kavanaghs appeared, but they had, of course, no documentary
evidence to advance against Sir Peter, who was adjudged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
the heir of Dygon, Baron of Idrone in the early part of the
fourteenth century. Prescription being again altogether ignored,
it was assumed as incontestable that Eva&#8217;s marriage
with Strongbow had carried the fee of Leinster with it.
The Kavanaghs, descendants of the royal tribe, and by Irish
law rightful owners of the land, were held common rebels
and trespassers, and were strictly enjoined to allow Carew
quiet possession. That the Crown had over and over again
negotiated with the Kavanaghs, and had twice created
baronies in their blood, was passed over as of no consequence.
Most of the Kavanaghs bowed to fate, and accepted Carew
as their landlord. The earth tillers had to pay him rent,
but were not otherwise dissatisfied with him, for he maintained
order in the district, and by the establishment of courts
baron provided for the due course of local justice. But
his name stank in the nostrils of those who had been accustomed
to fish in troubled waters, the kernes and idlemen of
Wexford and Carlow; and they watched for an opportunity
to rid themselves of this old man of the sea. They were not
long in finding a leader.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">James Fitzmaurice
supreme in
the
Desmond
country.</div>

<p>About the time that Desmond was making his submission
in London, James Fitzmaurice broke out in Kerry, having
strengthened his usual band by enlisting malcontents from
Limerick, Tipperary, and Cork. He began by taking 200
cows from Lord Fitzmaurice, wasting his country, and sitting
down before his castle of Lixnaw, though straightly charged
by the Lord Justice not to enter Clanmaurice. The cattle,
he said, were but security for rent, the other damages were
in return for those which the Lord of Lixnaw had previously
committed in Desmond. Causes of quarrel were sure to be
plentiful enough, and Lord Fitzmaurice had brought his wild
Irish friends from beyond the Shannon, so that perhaps there
was not much to choose between them. A battle followed,
in which James Fitzmaurice was defeated. At least 300 lives
were lost, and the sons of O&#8217;Callaghan, the White Knight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and others of his followers were taken. Finding himself too
weak to do much without help, the Desmond leader sought
allies both in and out of Ireland, living by plunder in the
meantime, and totally disregarding all letters from the
Government.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Butlers
oppose
Carew.
MacBrien
Arra.</div>

<p>On the very day that Sidney landed the Lords Justices
wrote most gloomily of the political prospect. Tirlogh
Luineach was in open rebellion; he had spoiled part of
Louth, and it was thought fortunate that he had escaped, for
he was in such force that had he turned upon Lord Louth
and his party he would probably have beaten them. On all
sides troubles were brewing; the Exchequer was empty, the
army weak, and the dark nights which the Irish loved were
coming on fast. But the greatest danger of all came from a
quarter whence governors were accustomed to look for support
only. The House of Ormonde itself seemed to have
changed its nature; the rod upon which every Viceroy had
leaned threatened to pierce the hand at last. Edward Butler,
the Earl&#8217;s younger brother, was a turbulent and hot-headed
youth. In the chief&#8217;s absence another brother, Sir Edmund,
had the care of his country, but he was unable, and perhaps
unwilling, to keep Edward properly in check. MacBrien
Arra, the chief of a clan which in the later Middle Ages had
wrested part of Tipperary from the Butlers, appears to have
been at this time peaceable and loyal, looking only to the
Government for protection against his greater neighbours.
Edward Butler probably thought him fair game, and invaded
Arra with 1,000 men, horse, foot, and camp followers&mdash;desperadoes
apparently of the worst character. According to
ancient Irish custom all movable property was stored in two
churches, and thither the frightened women fled in the vain
hope of sanctuary. The country was harried far and wide.
The churches were broken open, and for forty-eight hours
the invaders plundered and ravished, sparing neither age nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
condition. The lately gathered corn was destroyed, and
famine stared the whole population in the face. &#8216;As for me,
my good lords, I do not a little marvel of such deeds and facts,&#8217;
said MacBrien, &#8216;true subjects robbed and spoiled daily, and
poor tenants driven to beg their bread, banished from their
dwellings, and notable malefactors succoured and maintained,
contrary to the Queen&#8217;s Majesty&#8217;s good laws; assuring your
honours, since Shane O&#8217;Neill died, there is not the like maintainer
of rebels as Mr. Edward is; and although Sir Edmund
doth say that he cannot rule Mr. Edward of his riotous doings,
it is but a saying, and not true.&#8217; He desired redress, or leave
to revenge himself, and he went to Dublin to urge his suit.
The result was not altogether encouraging; for in his absence
Edward Butler visited his country a second time, killed his
uncle, drove off his cattle, and burned a house full of women
and children. Wearied with continual outrages, his wife
wrote to beg that he would take a farm in the Pale, where
there might be some chance of a quiet life. &#8216;When men go
to England,&#8217; she said, &#8216;or to Dublin, where the law is ministered,
those who remain behind spoil them the more.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Butlers and
O&#8217;Carrolls.</div>

<p>After his first attack on MacBrien, Edward Butler wandered
away into the King&#8217;s County. There was a standing
dispute between the O&#8217;Carrolls and the Butlers, the latter alleging
that Ely was part of Tipperary, the former that it belonged
to the more lately formed shire and was consequently outside
Ormonde&#8217;s palatinate jurisdiction. Thady O&#8217;Carroll, one of the
chief&#8217;s three sons, had married a Galway lady, and on his
way towards the Shannon to visit his father-in-law was unlucky
enough to come across Edward Butler&#8217;s band. O&#8217;Carroll
had but a few men with him, and it is therefore not at all
likely that he was the assailant in the skirmish which followed,
and in which he was taken prisoner. As to the previous
quarrels, which Butler alleged as a reason for keeping
armed men, the Lords Justices seem to have thought there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
was much to be said on both sides, but they charged Butler
to appear before them at once, and warned him of the danger
of taking the law into his own hands. Sir William O&#8217;Carroll
was also summoned, but neither were in any hurry to obey,
and the matter was quite unsettled when Sidney landed at
Carrickfergus.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney&#8217;s
plans for
Ulster.</div>

<p>Sidney lost no time in trying to realise his idea of bridling
the North with forts and bridges. He surveyed Clandeboye
and Ards, and declared them the shire of Carrickfergus&mdash;an
arrangement afterwards departed from. He met Tirlogh
Luineach at the Bann, and thought him inclined to obey.
The various castles already garrisoned he found in good
order, the people readily selling the soldiers a fat cow for
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and twenty-four eggs for 1<i>d.</i> In Carrickfergus a
good market was kept twice a week, to which commodities
were brought from the Pale, from Scotland and Man, and
even from France. Three 40-ton cargoes of claret were sold
at nine cowskins a hogshead. &#8216;The Archbishop of Armagh
and the Bishop of Meath, with divers noblemen and gentlemen
as well of England as the English Pale, lawyers, merchants,
and others came from Dublin to Carrickfergus, only
for visitation sake, the Bishops riding in their rochets, and
the rest unarmed.&#8217; A treaty was made with Sir Brian
MacPhelim to build a proper carriage bridge over the Laggan
at Belfast, to cut passes through the woods, to supply fuel
for making bricks, and to protect men building or repairing
ships in the Lough. On his road to Dublin most of the
chiefs and gentlemen came to pay their respects to the Lord
Deputy.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Scots.</div>

<p>Sidney believed that all Ulster difficulties originated in
Scotland. Argyle did not pretend to be guided by any rule but
the good of his own country, and he had 5,000 men always ready
to invade Ireland if he did not approve of Elizabeth&#8217;s policy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
He loved Sidney, he said, better than any other Viceroy, and
for that reason would rather see him anywhere than in Ulster.
Sir Francis Knollys was Scotland&#8217;s bitterest enemy, but he
would willingly put him in Sidney&#8217;s place, where he could do
far less harm than at Court. Lord Herries was not even careful
to use civil language. James MacDonnell&#8217;s widow professed
herself friendly, but said the clan would never forego
its Irish claims until it was quite extinct. Donnell Gorm,
born in Ireland and friendly to England, claimed the lordship
of the Isles, and was in alliance with the Campbells&mdash;a
reluctant tie which might easily be cut. His ancestors had
a pension of 200<i>l.</i> from England, and its renewal would be
money well spent. Rathlin Island, which was full of cattle&mdash;the
very stable and baiting-place of the Scots&mdash;should be
fortified and held, and this might be done for 300<i>l.</i> a year.
A regular military occupation of the whole province would be
intolerably costly, but half a dozen strong places on the coast
might be provided for 2,000<i>l.</i> yearly. A town at Armagh and
a bridge at Blackwater were quite necessary. In the meantime
Dundalk Bridge might be repaired, and Bagenal&#8217;s unfurnished
castles at Newry, Carlingford, and Greencastle might
be made tenable for 2,000<i>l.</i> If the Scots were once disposed
of, it would be easy to govern Ireland; the O&#8217;Neills would
then be shut up in their own province, and would have to work
or to starve.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">James Fitzmaurice.
The
Butlers.</div>

<p>When James Fitzmaurice found that Sidney had not
brought either the Earl or Sir John of Desmond with him,
he called a meeting of Geraldines, and informed them that
their chief and his brother were condemned to death, or at
least to perpetual imprisonment. He reminded them that
when the good Earl Thomas had been murdered by the tyrant
Earl of Worcester his followers had chosen a captain for themselves,
and he advised a like course. He was immediately
chosen by acclamation, and unhesitatingly accepted the position
in spite of Sidney&#8217;s threats. He was soon afterwards
proclaimed a traitor. The wise Earl of Clancare, as Shane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
O&#8217;Neill had in derision called him, placed himself about the
same time at the head of a Celtic confederacy, plundered Lord
Roche&#8217;s country, drove off the cattle, burned the sheep and the
corn, and killed men, women, and children. Neither wheat
nor oats were to be had for love or money west of Youghal:
the combined result of drought from heaven and heat from
the Earl of Clancare. Spanish ships supplied the MacCarthies
with arms. Edward Butler told Sidney&#8217;s messenger, who
found him at Thurles with 1,000 men, that no man of Irish
birth could be safe since Sir John of Desmond had been sent
to the Tower for little or nothing. He knew that he himself
had deeply offended his brother the Earl, and was therefore
afraid of Sir Edmund, who had also 1,000 men with him.
&#8216;Your secret conference, brother,&#8217; he said in the messenger&#8217;s
presence, &#8216;hath brought me to this mischief.&#8217; To Dublin he
refused to go without pardon or protection, and Shane O&#8217;Neill
hardly claimed more, even in his proudest days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ormonde&#8217;s
presence
declared
indispensable.</div>

<p>The presence of Ormonde alone could settle his country,
and he, in Sidney&#8217;s opinion, &#8216;politicly kept himself in England,
as well for duty&#8217;s sake to the Queen as ancient and
innate malice to the Earl of Desmond and all Desmondians.&#8217;
Sir Edmund could not brook the notion of dismissing his
armed followers, and, as he himself expressed it, &#8216;riding up
and down the country like a priest.&#8217; No brother or lieutenant
was of any use, and if Ormonde would not come Sidney would
have to go himself; and he begged for a strongly-worded
letter to show to the people. The report was that he was not
allowed to interfere with the Butler districts, and indeed he
was loth to do so, knowing that the Earl bore him little goodwill,
and that he had the Queen&#8217;s ear. &#8216;Though never so
upright,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I shall not escape slander.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lawless
conduct of
Ormonde&#8217;s
brethren.</div>

<p>Both Butlers continued their lawless practices; indeed,
Lady Dunboyne, who was a chief sufferer, declared that
Edward was &#8216;but a patch to Sir Edmund in extortion and
spoil.&#8217; He threatened her with yet worse things for having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
brought Sidney&#8217;s letters to him; and in the meantime seized
her cattle, nominally for the purpose of maintaining himself
against the White Knight, with whom he had picked a
quarrel to give an excuse for keeping his ragged battalion
together. Ormonde still lingering in England, the Lord
Deputy was obliged to go to Kilkenny himself, where he
hanged several of Edward Butler&#8217;s men, not by martial law,
as Sir Peter Carew proudly pointed out, but &#8216;by the verdict
of twelve men orderly.&#8217; A similar example was made at
Waterford, and Sidney returned to Dublin to make preparations
for holding a Parliament, in which he secured a majority
by interfering in elections.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of 1569.
Opposition
to Government.</div>

<p>No list has been preserved of the members who sat in
either House of Elizabeth&#8217;s second Irish Parliament. Many
Englishmen had, by Government influence, been returned for
remote places. Sidney, who had a taste for heraldic pomp,
was in some anxiety as to what dress he ought to wear. He
was told to do as St. Leger had done. If he could not find
whether St. Leger had used a garter or a Parliament robe, he
might do as he pleased. Princely robes of crimson velvet
lined with ermine were provided in due course, and the Lord
Deputy took his seat under the cloth of estate. Lord Chancellor
Weston made an eloquent speech on the advantages of
law and order. The House then separated, and James Stanihurst,
Recorder of Dublin, was again chosen Speaker of the
House of Commons by a large majority over Sir Christopher
Barnewall, who was also a lawyer and the candidate favoured
by the gentlemen of the Pale. After the usual protestations
of unfitness, Stanihurst was accepted by Sidney, and made a
speech in which he claimed personal inviolability for the members,
freedom of speech, and power for the House to punish
breaches of its own orders. The Lord Deputy, having granted
these suits, addressed the whole Parliament at great length.
None knew better, he said, than those in Ireland the advantages
of law and order; let them act according to that
knowledge, and be careful lest in defending their own
privileges they should tread upon her Majesty&#8217;s prerogative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
On the following day business began, and it soon appeared
that the House of Commons was divided into two parties
bitterly hostile to each other. The Court, or English party,
consisted chiefly of officials and of the Lord Deputy&#8217;s nominees,
men who might be trusted not to exhibit too much independence.
On the other side were the gentry of the Pale, the
burgesses returned by the old corporate towns, and the common
lawyers generally, who had been roughly handled by
Sidney in Sir Peter Carew&#8217;s case, and who asserted that some
of the English members were returned for towns not incorporated,
that sheriffs and mayors had returned themselves,
and that others were ignorant of their constituencies and non-resident.
The Judges held that the first and second objections
were good, but that there was nothing in the third. The
Attorney-General having reported this decision, which still
left the Government a majority, the Irish party professed not
to believe him, and demanded that the Judges themselves
should come down. The Speaker called for the orders of the
day, but the malcontents refused to listen to the first readings
of any bills. Next day the Judges came and confirmed their
former decision, but the Irish party, headed by Sir Edmund
Butler, still obstructed the business, and opposed the introduction
of a Bill for suspending Poyning&#8217;s Law and allowing
Bills to proceed without being first certified under the Great
Seal of England. This Bill was obviously for the enlargement
of their own jurisdiction, and passed in the end, as did
another which provided that the Great Seal of Ireland should
not be affixed to any further Suspension Bill until it had been
passed by the majority of both Irish Houses. After some
days spent in these bickerings, Hooker, who sat for Athenry&mdash;an
ancient borough certainly, but at this time containing
only four freeholders&mdash;made a long prerogative speech. He
had formerly represented Exeter and had a taste for antiquities,
and he proved to his own entire satisfaction that Moses
and Pythagoras, Camillus and Mithridates, had created precedents
on his side of the question. &#8216;The minority,&#8217; he says,
&#8216;did not hear the same so attentively as they did digest it
most unquietly.&#8217; The debate was adjourned, and Hooker had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
to be escorted by his friends to Sir Peter Carew&#8217;s house. The
next day Sir Christopher Barnewall and other lawyers inveighed
against Hooker, but the Speaker silenced them, and
desired them to put their complaints into writing. Hooker,
who says that the proceedings were more like bear-baiting
than the deliberations of a Senate, then presented a treatise on
the Order of Parliament, which closely followed English precedents,
and asserted the power of the Speaker to hold members
to the question, and to reform, correct, and punish disorder
with the advice of the House. The contest was not renewed,
and after the first fortnight matters settled down considerably.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Legislation.
Attainder
of Shane
O&#8217;Neill.</div>

<p>Sir Edmund Butler was openly censured by Sidney in the
Council Chamber, and withdrew in high dudgeon to his own
country. The House of Lords showed a mutinous spirit
as well as the Commons. The Gentleman Usher seems to
have occupied a position within the bar, and this being objected
to, Sidney withdrew the cloth of State, but it does not
appear that the punishment weighed very heavily on the delinquents.
Several Acts of great political importance were
passed. A subsidy of 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> on every plough land was granted
for ten years in consideration of the abolition of coyne and
livery. This was for the public benefit, but was very unpleasing
to many noblemen. The five principal men of each
shire were made responsible for the rest, Shane O&#8217;Neill was
attainted, the name of O&#8217;Neill extinguished, and the Queen
entitled to Tyrone. Irish captainries were abolished unless
established by patent. For the infringement of this law death
without benefit of clergy was provided by the draftsman in
England, but the House of Lords substituted a fine of 100 <i>l.</i>
for each offence by a peer, and 100 marks for men of lesser
degree. Even after this amendment there was much opposition,
which, as the Chancellor observed, argued that &#8216;the
matter misliked them more than the pain.&#8217; An Act was also
passed to enable the chief Governor, on certain conditions, to
make the remaining Irish countries into shire ground.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Wine
duties.</div>

<p>A Bill for imposing a heavy import duty on wines borne
in foreign bottoms was thrown out by the Commons, the
members for the port towns declaring that it would beggar
them utterly. The Bill was afterwards passed in a modified
form for ten years, Sidney having refused the enormous bribe
of 2,000<i>l.</i> in gold offered him to procure its withdrawal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Schools.</div>

<p>A Bill for the erection and maintenance of schools with
English masters by a charge on ecclesiastical property was
thrown out by the Bishops, who thought that they and not
the Lord Deputy should have the patronage in their own
hands, and with better reason demurred to the exemption of
impropriated lands, which were often the richest part of what
had belonged to the Church. A Bill for repairing churches
was thrown out by the Commons, the Catholics not caring to
provide for the Establishment, and no one wishing to bear
taxation. &#8216;Churches and schools,&#8217; said Weston, &#8216;still find no
favour among us, yet, in my opinion, the reformation of Ireland
must come from churches and schools.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
decides to
erect a
Presidency
in Munster.</div>

<p>The Queen&#8217;s consent for Ormonde&#8217;s departure had been
some time obtained before he actually started. He had to
raise money to pay his debts, but it is plain that Cecil thought
he delayed unnecessarily. He shone at Court, and was perhaps
in no haste to leave while the Queen&#8217;s manner encouraged
him to stay. In the meantime the state of the South became
daily worse, Sidney complaining bitterly that Sir Warham
St. Leger would have prevented all these troubles had not
Ormonde&#8217;s influence prevented him from being armed with
the necessary powers. The Queen selected Sir John Pollard
for the office of President of Munster, and Mr. Peryam,
Carew&#8217;s counsel, for his Chief Justice. The establishment was
fixed at 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a day for the President, with one Justice at
100<i>l.</i> a year and another at 40<i>l.</i>, and a clerk at 20<i>l.</i> The
whole expense with petty officers and soldiers was estimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
at 1,400<i>l.</i> Bacon and Winchester then suggested that there
need be no surgeon, and that fewer soldiers would do; which
cut down the estimate by one half. The Queen was delighted,
but Cecil, who had persuaded Pollard to accept the appointment,
was disgusted at the proposed breach of faith. In the
end he had his way, and Elizabeth sanctioned the higher scale.
Neither Pollard nor Peryam liked the work, and the latter,
who had had enough of Ireland, bitterly complained that he
would lose his practice at the bar, and that his family would
starve. His own stomach too was delicate, and &#8216;not to be
forced to any ordinary diet.&#8217; The Queen was inexorable, but
promised him leave to retire after two years&#8217; service. He
accompanied Pollard to Ilfracombe, where the Lord President
had a bad attack of gout. Peryam was glad of an excuse to
stay on the right side of the Channel. In the end both escaped
the dreaded duty, and another Devonshire gentleman,
Edmund Tremayne, went over to explain matters to Sidney.
Tremayne, to use his own language, had forsaken a quiet life,
and cared little for peace so he might fight in the good quarrel.
His voyage was dangerous enough to satisfy the most adventurous
man in Devon. The ship was first driven into Milford
Haven, and afterwards blown on to the Wexford coast; and
Tremayne and his party were attacked by the armed natives,
who were prepared to resist Sir Edmund Butler, now in open
rebellion. Finding that the castaways were Englishmen they
received them joyfully, and forwarded them to Ferns, where
Bishop Devereux gave them a most hospitable reception.
Tremayne reached Waterford safely, where he found it generally
reported that Ormonde was dead.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The rebellion
of
James Fitzmaurice
continues,
1569.</div>

<p>Fifteen months elapsed between the date of Pollard&#8217;s
abortive commission and the appointment of Sir John Perrott;
and for a long time the southern rebels met with no effectual
resistance. A cloud might at any time gather abroad; for the
papal Archbishop of Cashel and the papal Archbishop of Ross
were already in Spain with full powers to treat on behalf of
the confederated Catholics of Ireland, consisting of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
archbishops, eight bishops, and most of the lords and chieftains
outside the Pale. The sheriff of Cork at this time was the
renowned Richard Grenville, who had made a practical beginning
of colonisation by seizing lands to the west of Cork
Harbour. His martial prowess was no doubt feared, but no
sooner was his back turned than the country was in a flame.
On the very day after he sailed for England, Clancare and
Fitzmaurice appeared at Tracton with the seneschal of
Imokilly, the White Knight, and other chiefs. The garrison
appears to have been small, for the assailants were able to
undermine the walls with pickaxes, and to kill all the inmates
except three or four English soldiers, who were hanged next
day. James Fitzmaurice declared that help was coming from
Spain, swore on a book that Sir Edmund Butler was heartily
on his side, and boasted that he could take the artillery at
Kinsale when he pleased. The citizens of Cork were robbed
whenever they ventured out, and all the lords of the county
were either overawed or in sympathy with Fitzmaurice, who
vowed to give no peace to Cork until all the English, including
Lady St. Leger and Lady Grenville, were given up,
as well as some Irish prisoners. The city was in want both
of provisions and powder, and the town of Youghal hourly
expected an attack. English farmers in the immediate neighbourhood
had been already put to the sword.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney and
the Butlers.
Sir P.
Carew.</div>

<p>The unnatural alliance between Butlers and Geraldines
which made the insurrection formidable was in part at least
caused by Sidney&#8217;s harsh treatment of Sir Edmund Butler.
Not only did he use strong language himself, but he allowed
Sir Barnaby Fitzpatrick to do the like. Sir Edmund withdrew
from Dublin vowing vengeance against Fitzpatrick and
against Sir Henry Sidney personally; though he was at all
times careful to respect him in his official capacity. Sir
Edmund was driven to desperation by the success of Sir Peter
Carew and by the countenance which he received from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Lord Deputy; for his own castle of Clogrennan and the lands
attached formed part of Idrone, and having been originally
conquered from the Kavanaghs were included in the decision
of the Privy Council, which ousted their title to the
whole barony. Seeing that Sir Edmund would rebel, Sidney
sent to him Lord Baltinglass and Richard Shee, the latter a
devoted adherent of the House of Ormonde, with instructions
to talk him over if possible. They went from place to place
looking for him while he plundered the country, and when
they at last came up with him his conduct was not particularly
edifying. He bade them give over their flattery, bragging,
and dissimulation, and declared that neither he nor his brethren
would come near the Lord Deputy without pardon or protection
for all concerned, that the Deputy&#8217;s object was to
chop off their heads, and that all the mischief had been caused
by the machinations of Carew and of Sir Barnaby Fitzpatrick.
The Queen herself, said Sir Edmund, was the only judge by
whom he would submit to be tried; to her he was more loyal
than they who accused him, and if he were proclaimed rebel
he would make the heads of those who caused it fly from their
bodies. If he and his men had pardon and protection he
would be ready to attend the Lord Deputy in all wars; but
if any of the Queen&#8217;s men helped Sir Barnaby or his other
enemies, so her Highness or her Governor were not personally
in the field, then he would do them all the mischief
he could. Similar offers were made through a private
messenger, and Sidney&#8217;s answer was to send Carew and
Humphrey Gilbert, who now makes his first appearance in Irish
history, with orders to apprehend Sir Edmund. A country
neighbour afterwards tried to bring him into a more prudent
frame of mind, but again the answer was, &#8216;I do not make war
against the Queen, but against those that banish Ireland, and
mean conquest.... If my lord my brother come to apprehend
me, I will not in this quarrel be ruled by him nor come
in his hands.&#8217; If anything would have persuaded him it was
Mr. Sweetman&#8217;s taunt that he was more a Desmond than a
Butler; but he was past caring for this, and boasted that if
Sidney invaded the South, Tirlogh Luineach would invade the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Pale. He was already proclaimed rebel, and as if to prove
the justice of that measure he exhibited letters from O&#8217;Neill
and Fitzmaurice.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Geraldines

<p>The Queen chided Sidney for coupling Sir Edmund&#8217;s name
with Fitzmaurice&#8217;s and MacCarthymore&#8217;s, for which, however,
there was abundant justification, and she let Ormonde go as
the only chance of restoring peace. Before he could leave
London, his brothers Edmund, Piers, and Edward had joined
Fitzmaurice, with whom MacCarthy had made plans for concerted
action. The Butlers had done their own part by devastating
the eastern part of the Queen&#8217;s County, and killing the
warders of Balliknockane. Fitzmaurice followed up the blow
by attacking Kilmallock and extorting a ransom of 160<i>l.</i>, the
townsmen fearing that they would after all have to receive
a Geraldine garrison. He met the Earl of Thomond and John
Burke close to Limerick, and the citizens, who feared to lose
all their cattle, were in some doubt as to the proper course.
The men of Waterford, as became the city&#8217;s ancient reputation,
did not wait for orders, but worked hard at their fortifications,
sent provisions to Cork and Youghal, and gave shelter to the
miserable inhabitants of the country. They reported that
the Geraldine rebels burned and slew where they listed,
stripping honest men and women naked and using more
cruel tortures &#8216;than either Phalaris or any of the old tyrants
could invent.&#8217; Even before the open rebellion great disorders
had been caused by the general poverty. On Good Friday
the city, according to ancient custom, opened its gates to 1,100
poor men, who, when they had eaten, fell to plundering and
housebreaking; and it took three weeks to get rid of them by
beating out the sturdy beggars, and coaxing out those of a
weaker sort. Corn was daily growing dearer, and &#8216;the caterpillars&#8217;
boasted that they would reap the next harvest. The
kine, &#8216;which by milk used to keep the poor wretches alive,&#8217;
were killed or driven away. Edward Butler had devastated
Waterford County, but the citizens feared nothing. To attack
them without the aid of a foreign prince would be to &#8216;spurn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
against a wall,&#8217; and Spain was of no such force in Ireland as
their own sovereign liege.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Waterford
and Cork.</div>

<p>Waterford was a stronghold for its own people, and a city
of refuge for many others, but the rebels had complete possession
of the open country. English settlers were plundered
and killed, or led about with halters round their necks. Sir
Edmund Butler and his brother Piers devoted themselves to
the district between Waterford and the Pale, of which the
northern boundary was threatened by Tirlogh Luineach.
Edward Butler was busy south-west of Waterford, and Fitzmaurice
preached a crusade in the Desmond country, calling
upon the citizens of Cork and the clergy of the diocese to send
away all Protestants by the next wind. &#8216;The Queen,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;is not satisfied with our worldly goods, bellies, and lives, but
must also counsel us to forsake the Catholic faith by God unto
His Church given, and by the See of Rome hitherto prescribed
to all Christian men.... If you follow not this Catholic
and wholesome exhortation, I will not nor may not be your
friend.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Carew and
the Butlers.</div>

<p>Unable for the moment to visit the South, Sidney sent
Carew and Gilbert to Kilkenny, in a sally from which town
they inflicted a severe defeat on Sir Edmund Butler. In a
second encounter Carew was less successful, but was able,
within a few days, to lay siege to Clogrennan, which the
garrison had orders to defend against all but the Lord
Deputy himself. Hooker represents the capture of this
castle as a great feat of arms, but Ormonde says that it contained
only eight armed men. Being hard pressed, the commandant
asked if Sidney was present, and being told that he
was, went out on safe-conduct. Finding himself deceived,
he returned into the house, but a soldier named Baker
followed, shot or stabbed him in the back, and threw a log of
wood between the doors, so that they could not be shut.
Carew&#8217;s men then poured in, and killed not only the garrison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
but the women and children, including &#8216;an honest gentleman&#8217;s
son, not three years old.&#8217; This rascally breach of faith is
represented by Hooker as fair stratagem of war.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Atrocities
on both
sides.</div>

<p>It is needless to recapitulate all the outrages committed
on either side, or to inquire whether certain attempts on
Carew&#8217;s life were instigated by Sir Edmund Butler or not;
but Enniscorthy was remarkable for the rapes and murders
committed on the merchants and their families frequenting
the great annual fair on August 15. Agriculture was quite
neglected, and few houses were inhabited except those belonging
to Ormonde. Carew laid all the blame on Irish ferocity,
but Ormonde declared that the mischief was caused by rash
attacks on landed property, which were shaking the loyalty
of the highest and noblest. Sir Edmund had been a good
subject, and was rewarded by losing his estate. He tried to
defend his property, and was proclaimed a traitor. &#8216;A wiser
man than he,&#8217; said his brother, &#8216;might be brought beside
himself thus.&#8217; The following is too interesting to omit:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sinister
rumours.</div>

<p>&#8216;Old Grace, my man,&#8217; the Earl wrote, &#8216;landed three weeks
ago in Waterford sore handled with gout; my brother hearing
of his being there came to the waterside to talk with him.
Grace was carried between men to his boat, and in the boat
talked with my brother, who asked very earnestly of the
Queen&#8217;s Majesty. The other told him she was in health and
very well. "No, no," says he, "I know well enough she is
poisoned, and my brother put into the Tower and there put
to death." My man told him he might know my handwriting:
he answered my letter bore an old date. He asked again
twice if the Queen were alive. The other sware she was
alive and in as good health as ever she was. "Well," said my
brother, "if my lord is alive and that I may see him, I
will believe his word, and then will I go into England and
let her Highness know how I am dealt withal by my Lord
Deputy and Sir Peter Carew."&#8217;</p>

<p>Fitzmaurice, Clancare, and the Butlers between them had
near 4,500 men, with whom they laid siege to Kilkenny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
The townsmen had been reinforced by Captain Collyer&#8217;s company,
but they gave hostages to prevent the suburbs from
being burned. Without artillery the rebels could hardly take
a well-defended walled town, and they could not keep the
field long enough to starve out such a good soldier as Collyer.
Piers Butler burned all the houses at Leighlin, and killed
even children, but he did not attack the castle, which contained
twelve able men. The roads were so closely beset
that communication with Dublin was almost impossible. But
Sir Edmund&#8217;s heart was not entirely in the business. He
told Fitzwilliam that he would oppose neither the Queen nor
her Deputy if they appeared in person, that he would not
meddle in matters of religion, and that he would have
nothing to do with the introduction of Spaniards.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Return of
Ormonde.</div>

<p>&#8216;It was never seen,&#8217; wrote Ormonde proudly, &#8216;that any
traitor remained one night in camp in my country while I
served in Ireland. I lament to hear of this wicked time. I
would God I had 1,000 men at my landing in Waterford,
to try my fortune among these caterpillars.&#8217; At last he
sailed, and was driven to Roslare in Wexford, where he
landed. He wrote to ask Sidney, who was by this time at
Cork, for an escort. His horses, he said, had all been taken,
and he did not yet know whom to trust; but Sidney doubted
this too powerful subject, and told him that he could easily
go to Castlemartyr, Kilmallock, or Limerick without help.
A fortnight was wasted at Waterford, no one joining the
Earl but a few chance Wexford men, and he then made his
way to Kilkenny, where his three brothers came to him. Sir
Edmund at once asked after the Queen, and on being told
that she was well, doffed his morion and thanked God. The
other two followed suit. Sir Edmund recapitulated with
much energy his charges against Carew and Sidney, took
God to witness, and prayed he might be damned body and
soul if ever he meant to rebel. He was ready to serve in
France or anywhere in Ireland, so that he was not bound
to come to my Lord Deputy&#8217;s presence, or to serve in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
company. Ormonde tried to persuade him to go to Sidney,
but he wept like a child, saying he would rather go to England
unprotected than to Dublin on the best safe-conduct.
He was ready to be tried by the Queen, but not by his declared
enemy. At length the three Butlers surrendered to
the Earl on safe-conduct, the further consideration of their
case being reserved until the Lord Deputy&#8217;s pleasure should
be known.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney goes

South.
Position of
Ormonde in
Tipperary.</div>

<p>Sidney left Dublin late in July with 600 men, Sir Barnaby
Fitzpatrick, &#8216;the most sufficient man in counsel and action
for the war that ever I found of that country birth,&#8217; being left
to guard the southern frontier of the Pale, while Fitzwilliam
and Kildare held the O&#8217;Neills in check as best they might.
After visiting and rebuking Kilkenny, the Lord Deputy entered
Tipperary, the rebels burning their houses in front of
him. His first intention was to go straight to Cork, where
the citizens entertained the notion of giving Lady St. Leger
up to Fitzmaurice, but hearing that a relieving force of 400
men had arrived by sea from England, he encamped near
Clonmel, where he found the people good and loyal. Written
challenges were thrown into the camp, promising that the
rebels would fight him, and he sent for reinforcements to
Waterford. The citizens answered that they had no spare
men, and that besides they were exempted by their charter;
but they had afterwards to pay a fine for their stiff-necked
conduct. Proclamation of pardon had no effect, and the palatinate
jurisdiction of the House of Ormonde was advanced by
the principal gentlemen of Tipperary as a reason for not
exerting themselves to restore order. &#8216;We are,&#8217; they said,
&#8216;of this county more ancient inhabiters and freeholders than
any Butler is, and were the first conquerors of this soil from
the Irishry.... England gave us away to a Butler....
We and our ancestors acknowledged him as our lord and
captain, and indeed we know no other sovereign but him,
whose lieutenant, Sir Edmund Butler, his brother and heir-apparent,
is him we follow, and him we will follow and do as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
he commandeth us.&#8217; Messengers to the chief rebels failed.
They reported, not quite truly, perhaps, Sir Edmund Butler&#8217;s
opinion that Leicester, Ormonde&#8217;s mortal foe, was about to
marry the Queen and be King, and that Sidney was to be King
of Ireland under him, &#8216;as might appear,&#8217; the Lord Deputy said,
&#8216;by bearing the ragged staff continually in my pensile before
me, as indeed I did.&#8217; &#8216;That blessed babe, Edward Butler,&#8217; who
had been Sidney&#8217;s page, professed great affection for his old
master, and hoped that he would not go on to meet certain
disaster. He had done all, he said, by Ormonde&#8217;s orders. Sir
Theobald Butler of Cahir, who was always trying to assert his
independence of Ormonde, was the only one of the family who
voluntarily came to Sidney, by whom he was recommended
for a peerage.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney
persuades
his men to
advance.</div>

<p>Negotiations having failed, Sidney&#8217;s drum beat to quarters,
but the men showed a great disinclination to advance. He was
a fluent and persuasive speaker, and he addressed the troops,
serving out wine plentifully at the same time. By the time
the speech and the wine were finished, the soldiers began to
cry &#8216;Forward,&#8217; and to declare that they would follow to the
land&#8217;s end or die on the road. They demanded to be led out
at once. &#8216;"Nay, fast, sirs," quoth I, "it is Sunday, and it is
afternoon; we will go hear evening prayer, sup and rest; and
you shall be called, I warrant you, betimes in the morning,
and so, in the name of God, we will advance forwards." That
evening and all the night there was nothing but singing,
casting of bullets, drying of powder, filing of pike-heads,
sharpening of swords, and everyone thinking himself good
enough for five rebels.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney

Fitzmaurice
burns Kilmallock.</div>

<p>Sidney marched next morning by Cahir into the White
Knight&#8217;s country, and laid siege to a castle, which was perhaps
Mitchelstown. The garrison said they held the place
for God and James Fitzmaurice and the White Knight, and
that they would yield to only one of them in person, or to
St. Peter or St. Paul. Sidney had no artillery heavy enough
to breach the main walls, but shattered the upper works, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
ultimately won the courtyard and barbican by assault. The
garrison retired into the vaulted chamber of the keep; but
this also was assaulted, and they were pursued to the top
story, and then thrown over the battlements. Lord Roche&#8217;s
son was left in possession. Sidney pushed on to Cork, where
Lady St. Leger was fully relieved, and the wavering citizens
confirmed in their allegiance. Carrigaline was taken and
garrisoned, and Castlemartyr, which the seneschal of Imokilly
held against the Crown, was summoned. The seneschal himself
answered that he would defend it to the last. A day or two
having been spent in preparing gabions, a small breach was
effected, and the garrison escaped by night into a neighbouring
bog. The castle was entrusted to Captain Jasper Horsey,
and Sidney then visited the Mallow district. After some
pulling down of castles and wasting of country, the chiefs
submitted without protection, and took the oath of allegiance.
Buttevant, which Lord Barrymore had mortgaged to Desmond,
was taken, and the Queen, as Sidney grimly said, was made
mortgagee. Passing on to Limerick, Sidney found that Fitzmaurice
had been before him at Kilmallock, which he had
carried by escalade with the help of sympathisers inside.
Some houses were sacked, others burned, others ransomed,
and others spared altogether. Here Sidney heard from Ormonde,
who could not join for want of convoy. Lord Power
and the Earl&#8217;s friend Lord Decies were sent to Kilkenny,
and they brought him safe to the Lord Deputy at Limerick.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney
Limerick.</div>

<p>Thomas Roe Fitzgerald, Desmond&#8217;s half-brother by Catherine
Roche, was induced by Sidney to serve the Queen&mdash;a
stroke of policy which greatly weakened Fitzmaurice, since
many Geraldines thought his title better than that of the acknowledged
Earl, and of course far better than his cousin&#8217;s.
&#8216;During my abode in Limerick,&#8217; says Sidney, &#8216;there came to
me divers principal personages of the county of Kerry and of
Connello, as the Lord Fitzmaurice, William Burke, captain or
owner of Clanwilliam, whose eldest son after (being my man)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
with his own hand killed James Fitzmaurice, and James him
at one only encounter, Lacy, Purcell, and Suppell, with many
more whose names I have forgotten, being all descended of
English race; all sware allegiance to her Majesty and faithful
service in that action against James. There came to me also
Rory MacSheehy, captain-general of the Earl of Desmond&#8217;s
gallowglasses, surnamed Clansheehy; he likewise submitted,
sware allegiance, and delivered pledges as before. This man
was counted one of much might among them; he procured
to come to me a great many more of the Irishry.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

of the
Butlers.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Sir
Edmund
escapes
from
Dublin
Castle.</div>

<p>No doubt by his brother&#8217;s advice, Sir Edmund Butler
wrote to Cecil, throwing himself on the Queen&#8217;s mercy; and
it seems that he set out to join the Lord Deputy, but thought
better of it on the road. Piers lay in pleurisy at Kilkenny,
but Edward accompanied the Earl to Limerick, and made his
unconditional submission. Sidney seems still to have called
him traitor, but he declared himself willing to serve the
Queen anywhere. Afterwards Ormonde gave his parole for
him, and he executed a bond binding himself to appear at
Dublin when sent for, and if possible to bring Piers and Edmund
with him. &#8216;I granted his requests,&#8217; said Sidney, &#8216;but
since that time I could never set eye on my old servant
Edward.&#8217; Some weeks later Ormonde brought Sir Edmund
and Piers to the Lord Deputy at Dublin, Edward being this
time the defaulter. When the brothers were brought before
the Council Sir Edmund accused Sidney of having threatened
him, but this the Lord Deputy denied, and we have the testimony
of an eye-witness to his gravity and dignity. But it
seems that faith was not strictly kept, for Sir Edmund had
come in upon safe-conduct granted by Ormonde to &#8216;come
safe, remain, and go safe,&#8217; that Ormonde had full power to
grant such safe-conduct, but that nevertheless Sir Edmund
was imprisoned in the castle. After a short and very indulgent
confinement, he managed to obtain a rope and slipped
down the wall, but hurt himself, and fell into the ditch. He
lay all night in the water&mdash;it was November&mdash;and those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
found him in the morning were friends. The young O&#8217;Byrnes,
the afterwards renowned Feagh MacHugh being one of them,
led him through the Wicklow Mountains, and he made his
way once more to the neighbourhood of Leighlin. He soon
afterwards visited Holy Cross, and offered a thank-offering for
his escape. Sidney was highly indignant, but if he really
broke Ormonde&#8217;s safe-conduct he had nothing better to
expect. He insinuated doubts as to the sincerity of the
Earl&#8217;s professions, but he had not gone the right way to confirm
his loyalty. Ormonde, on the other hand, reported that
Sidney was too jealous of him to avail himself of his services
against the Munster rebels.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Humphrey
Gilbert in
Munster.</div>

<p>The rank of colonel was given to Humphrey Gilbert, and
he was told to pacify Munster. He showed all those qualities
which have given him an enduring place in English story.
Kilmallock was again threatened, and Gilbert occupied it
with little more than two companies. Fitzmaurice and Clancare
brought 1,500 foot and 60 horse, intending to starve out
the garrison; but Gilbert sallied forth with about 100 men,
and put the Irish to flight, exhibiting the Quixotic courage
for which he is famous. He had a horse shot under him.
His buckler was transfixed by a spear. He advanced to the
attack across a river, and had twenty mounted men upon him
at once, of which he slew one, unhorsed two, and wounded six.
No wonder that he had a fever after this. Gilbert&#8217;s energy
seems to have paralysed the enemy, for he marched almost
unopposed through the wilds of Kerry and Connello, and
took thirty or forty castles without artillery. The policy
pursued was like that of Samuel to the subjects of Agag. At
Garrystown Gilbert ordered Captain Warde to put all to the
sword on pain of death. No capitulation was admitted, but
all strongholds were stormed at any cost, and men, women,
and children killed. &#8216;They are now,&#8217; wrote Warde, after
three weeks of this horrid work, &#8216;so well acquainted with his
conditions that I think they will defend no castle.&#8217; And the
worthy captain adds that all were astonished at Gilbert&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
sufficiency, and that in his opinion he was fit for any place,
civil or military.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzmaurice
is hard
pressed.</div>

<p>James Fitzmaurice himself found the battle so hot about
him that he withdrew, closely pursued, into the glen of Aherlow
in Tipperary, and Sidney complained that Ormonde was
slack in his service, and that they were afraid of the Queen&#8217;s
displeasure if they entered his country to do the work which
he neglected. Sidney called Fitzmaurice an Irish beggar,
Gilbert called him a silly wood-kerne, and both wondered that
an Earl of Ormonde should find any difficulty in dealing with
him. The Butlers were an ungrateful crew, and Gilbert
would teach them, if he might, that they had more need of
the Queen&#8217;s mercy than she had of their service. The Queen&#8217;s
partiality made it necessary to keep some terms with Ormonde,
but Gilbert did not hesitate &#8216;to infringe the pretended liberties
of any city or town corporate not knowing their charters
to further the Queen&#8217;s Majesty&#8217;s service, answering them that
the prince had a regular and absolute power, and that which
might not be done by the one, I would do it by the other in
case of necessity.&#8217; Gilbert was satisfied that Ireland, being
a conquered nation, would never obey for love, but for fear
only; and he acted fully up to this opinion. Under his
drastic treatment all the Geraldines except James Fitzmaurice
submitted. Captain Apsley was sent into Kerry, and such
was the terror inspired by his colonel, that the whole district
was reduced with little difficulty. Clancare and MacDonough
MacCarthy acknowledged their treasons on their knees. Gilbert
would promise no pardons, and every rebel taken in arms
was executed at once. After his service in Munster, Gilbert
repaired to the Lord Deputy, who knighted him, having
nothing but honour to give. In his despatches he praised
him to the skies, and seems not to have had the slightest
misgiving about the wisdom or morality of his conduct. The
ways were safe. City gates lay open. The English name
was never so much feared in Ireland. It needed now only a
good sour lawyer to manage the escheats of forfeited lands.
&#8216;If her Majesty will provide, that which is spent is not lost.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Persuade her to address into Munster further a council with a
President. The iron is now hot to receive what print shall
be stricken in it, but if it be suffered to grow cold, I fear
where before it was iron it will then be found steel. These people
are headstrong, and if they feel the curb loosed but one link,
they will, with bit in the teeth, in one month run further out
of the career of good order than they will be brought back
in three months.&#8217; Without money, thwarted at home, and
in bad health, the Lord Deputy begged earnestly for his recall.
All classes were against him, and he felt as if he could not
live another six months in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ulster is
quiet.</div>

<p>While Geraldines and Butlers, for once united by the fear
of losing their lands, kept the South of Ireland in a turmoil,
Ulster, for Ulster, was rather unusually quiet. The O&#8217;Neills
feared to provoke Sidney while he had the power to punish,
and minor chiefs professed themselves ready to obey his call.
James MacDonnell&#8217;s widow took advantage of the lull to
come to Rathlin and give her hand to Tirlogh Luineach, who
had now from 3,000 to 5,000 men under his orders, his wife
having brought at least 1,200 Scots with her. Newry was
threatened, but the arrival of Ormonde left Kildare free, and
the forces of the Pale were drawn northwards. Sidney followed
as soon as he could, and found that the Scots had
weakened rather than strengthened Tirlogh Luineach, who
had &#8216;eaten himself out&#8217; by supporting them. The fact that
he had been accidentally shot by a jester while sitting at
supper with his new wife, may have had a good deal to do
with Tirlogh Luineach&#8217;s inactivity. In any case, he gave
Fitzmaurice no help; and, the Butlers having submitted, the
confederacy from which so much had been expected and
feared fell to pieces of itself.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitton, President
of
Connaught.</div>

<p>Pollard&#8217;s illness had delayed the formation of a presidential
Government in Munster, but Sir Edward Fitton was appointed
to Connaught, with Ralph Rokeby for a Chief Justice.
When the decadence of the southern rebellion enabled him
to begin work, he did not show much talent for government,
being an ill-tempered, quarrelsome man, not at all fitted for
the delicate duty of turning Irish into English order. The
townsmen of Galway he found loyal and peaceable enough,
but the people of the province were cold in religion, and
inclined to superstition. By way of encouragement he
burned the &#8216;idols&#8217; in the churches. The friars were nominally
expelled, really driven into hiding. More praiseworthy
were his efforts to make the clergy either put away or marry
their female companions&mdash;efforts extended to the laity, who,
from the Earl of Clanricarde downwards, seem to have held
canonical marriage in contempt. Malefactors were executed,
a kind of census taken, and a provost-marshal appointed to
hang out of hand all who could find no one to answer for
them. &#8216;Such as do come unto us, we cause to cut their
glybbes, which we do think the first token of obedience.&#8217;
Clanricarde and O&#8217;Connor Sligo professed some agreement
with Fitton&#8217;s course, but O&#8217;Rourke held aloof, while Thomond
gave every possible opposition, even to the extent of detaining
Captain Apsley and his men on their return from Kerry,
and of threatening to capture the President himself. Proclamation
had been made for holding assizes at Ennis, where
the sheriff, Teig O&#8217;Brien, made store of provisions for the
President. Thomond, who was at Clare close by, refused to
attend, and when the assizes were over friendly partisans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
conducted Fitton through the Burren Mountains, the Earl
hanging on his skirts and skirmishing as far as Gort. He
was said to be acting under orders from the Duke of Norfolk,
and no doubt his conduct had reference to the rising in the
North, and to the general attack on those whom Fitzmaurice
called Huguenots. Fitton was shut up in Galway, and John
Burke, Clanricarde&#8217;s rebellious son, rode up to the gate, but
refused to enter. Gilbert having departed, Fitzmaurice
gathered a new force, entered and spoiled Kilmallock; and
there seemed every prospect of a conflagration throughout
the West. Sidney resolved to take Ormonde at his word,
and to employ him in putting down this fresh disturbance.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ormonde is
reconciled
to Sidney,</div>

<p>&#8216;My Lord Deputy and I,&#8217; Ormonde wrote to Cecil, &#8216;brake
our minds at Leighlin last together before some of our trusty
friends, and after promising never to call quarrels past to
rehearsal, we vowed the renewal of our old friendship. So,
for my part, I will bring no matter past to rehearsal.&#8217;
Thereupon he begged the intercession of Cecil and other
statesmen for his misguided brothers. Edward was still at
large.</p>

<p>&#8216;I think,&#8217; said Sidney, &#8216;God have ordained him a sacrifice
for the rest. What honour were it to that house if the
Earl would bring in that brother&#8217;s head with his own hands?
That were indeed a purging sacrifice.&#8217; It was a sacrifice
which Ormonde did not feel called upon to offer; but he was
willing enough to serve the Queen, and received a commission
to reduce his cousin, the Earl of Thomond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and
receives a
commission.</div>

<p>He received an ample commission, having power to proclaim
rebels, to parley, protect, or prosecute as he might
think expedient. After a month&#8217;s preparation he was in
a condition to take the field. He had no help from the
Government but 300 kerne and a battering-ram, which he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
not use. The Mayor of Limerick made difficulties about
boats to convey the guns across the Shannon, and Ormonde
marched into Thomond without them. The terror of his
name and the knowledge that artillery was behind did all
that was necessary, but he complained that nothing was
done unless he did it himself, and that Sir Thomas Roe Fitzgerald
was particularly useless. Thomond at once offered to
give up all prisoners, English and Irish, to surrender all
castles, provided he might be allowed to go to England and
plead his own cause with the Queen, and to serve at once against
James Fitzmaurice. He stipulated for life and liberty for
himself, that Ormonde should have the custody of his country,
that his enemy, Teig MacMorragh of Inchiquin, should be no
longer sheriff, that the Lord Deputy and Lord President
should not prejudice his case with her Majesty, and that he
should be allowed five days&#8217; law before being proclaimed
traitor, in the event of Sidney refusing to ratify the articles.
Ormonde took possession of all the castles at once, garrisoned
them, and secured the prisoners, cutting passes through the
wood to Bunratty in case further fighting should be necessary.
The rest he left to the Lord Deputy. Sidney would have
preferred that Thomond should come before him, but agreed
to let him go to the Queen, on condition that he should give
the names of all his accomplices at once and start for England
before May 27.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Thomond
goes to
France.
Intrigues
there.</div>

<p>The rebel Earl, who was probably conscious of intrigues
of which Ormonde knew nothing, neglected, without actually
refusing, to go to the Lord Deputy, allowed the day of grace
to pass, and went quietly on board a French ship which lay
in the Shannon. Thomond was pacified entirely at Ormonde&#8217;s
charge, and the work was done but just in time, for
many of his men had been engaged in the late rebellion, and
were fighting with halters round their necks. The moment
their protections expired they left their chief, who had no
power to extend them, but they seem to have returned on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the Lord Deputy giving them six weeks longer. The principal
men of the O&#8217;Briens submitted, and the O&#8217;Loughlins
and O&#8217;Mahons followed suit. There were a few executions,
but Ormonde preferred clemency to the policy of Gilbert or
even of Sidney. &#8216;The Queen,&#8217; he said, &#8216;hath many good
subjects here if they were but cherished and not over-pressed.&#8217;
His reception in France not answering his expectation,
Thomond thought it prudent to report himself to
the English ambassador, representing himself as a loyal subject
driven mad by Fitton&#8217;s harshness. He professed great
anxiety to see the Queen, but feared the Lord Deputy. He
had come by France, as the direct road to London was closed.
Norris advised lenity in dealing with one who was evidently
rather a tool than a ringleader&mdash;a barbarian whose cunning
was neutralised by his vaingloriousness, and whose simple
talk could deceive no diplomatist. &#8216;Promise what you list,&#8217;
said the ambassador, whose great object was to coax the
refugee out of France into England, &#8216;and having him there
perform what you list.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diplomacy.</div>

<p>The Queen lent no countenance to this Machiavellian
advice, and told Norris that the Irish lord was of small value
but by her favour, and not the best of his name in the
estimation of his own countrymen. By her advice he gave
a written personal undertaking that Thomond should not be
imprisoned on his promising, also in writing, to make no
further attempt against the Queen. He had from his arrival
intrigued with the French Court, and had nearly succeeded
in captivating Henry III.; but Marshal Vielleville reminded
his sovereign that he had debts, and persuaded him not to
meddle with castles in Ireland. Catherine de&#8217; Medici tried
to prevent Thomond from going to England, and gave him
200 pistoles. Fearful lest he should go to Spain, Norris
added 100, and after spending a month in Paris, the Earl
was induced to go to his natural sovereign and make humble
submission. He was pardoned in due course and sent back
to Ireland, where he bound himself in the sum of 10,000<i>l.</i> to
be of good behaviour for the future.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney&#8217;s

Edward
Butler
cannot be
caught.</div>

<p>While Ormonde showed his zeal in the West, the Lord
Deputy remained in Dublin preparing to meet Parliament.
He begged to be recalled, or at least to have the comfort of
his wife&#8217;s society, for that he was living very uncomfortably,
and at intolerable expense to himself, though saving much
to the Queen. To his repeated cries her Majesty answered
that he should be relieved as soon as possible, but that it was
very difficult to find a fit successor for him, or a fit governor
for Munster. She approved of his fortifying policy in Ulster.
Irishmen were to be encouraged to take estates of the Crown,
and Englishmen to settle in Ireland, and &#8216;we would have
good regard that the inhabitants there do not engross many
farms into few hands, whereby hospitality must decay.&#8217;
Edmund and Piers Butler were to be committed; Edward
caught, indicted, and arraigned; and all three were to be
made to surrender their estates, and have judgment passed
on them, to be executed or not according to their behaviour.
Their inferior agents in rebellion were to &#8216;taste the reward
of justice.&#8217; Edward Butler could not be caught, though he
had at least one narrow escape from his brother&#8217;s men, but the
other two had remained in Dublin since their submission, and
now humbly awaited her Majesty&#8217;s pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Final submission
of
the Butlers,
1570.
Parliament.</div>

<p>Sidney found his Parliament in more submissive mood
than at its first meeting, the Irish party having been cowed
by his vigour, and by the sight of unsuccessful rebellion.
The influence of a Speaker must needs be considerable, and
Stanihurst was devoted to the Government, which received
valuable support from his grave and conciliatory demeanour.
The Lord Deputy opened the session with a pithy speech, in
which he earnestly prayed the members to show their activity
by amending Bills brought before them, but not by rejecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
necessary measures. An Act was then passed reciting the
Queen&#8217;s efforts to establish order and justice, notwithstanding
which &#8216;the wicked, better acquainted with darkness than
light, have chosen to wallow in their own filth and puddle of
tyranny, oppression, rape, ravine, and spoil.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attainders.</div>

<p>Clancare, Fitzmaurice, Ormonde&#8217;s three brothers, and
several other Butlers of less note, were then attainted by
name as &#8216;vile and ingrate traitors;&#8217; and treasons committed
within a limited time were prospectively included in the
attainder. The Queen stayed the execution of this Act, but
Ormonde objected to it on general grounds, and especially to
its prospective effect. &#8216;Alas,&#8217; he said, &#8216;what availeth life, and
to live with infamy (as I perceive my brethren must do
coming to arraignment)! But the Queen&#8217;s staying of their
judgment and execution is an exceeding mercy, far above
their deserts of late days ... and for the stain of my house
I confesseth it nippeth me to the heart. But what remedy
the best is they may, with the Queen&#8217;s goodness, live to
requite this evil with good service hereafter.... My brother
Edmond was not his own man since he was bewitched. Myself
have not escaped free by means of a drink given me by
some unhappy hand. I recovered hardly by drinking salt
and oil, bleeding very much, and being purged. I bled forty
ounces at twenty-one times.... This act is very general,
and so perilous that the judgment is given before the offence
committed. Many innocents may be indicted upon malice,
and peradventure have no notice of the proclamation to come
to justify themselves according to the law.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Butlers
pardoned.</div>

<p>Sir Edmund, who was certainly of an excitable nature,
felt the disgrace so keenly that he was actually out of his
mind for a time. Later on, when it was proposed to print
the Act in London, Ormonde complained bitterly that the
praise of suppressing the rebellion was given in general
terms to Sidney, and begged that &#8216;the odious discourse&#8217; might
be kept back. Some Butlers were, indeed, by God&#8217;s visitation
induced to act beyond their reason, and the family
honours had been spotted for the first time; but the head of
the House had brought them back, and the tree now bore its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
accustomed good fruit. Edward Butler at last submitted to
the Earl, but seems never to have put himself into Sidney&#8217;s
power. In 1573 the three brothers were pardoned, but it
seems that by some omission they were never restored in
blood. The legal stain remained, but the moral stain was
removed by much after good service.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">First

education.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition
to Government
Bills.</div>

<p>An Act was passed in this session for the erection of a
free school in every diocese at the cost of the diocese, with
an English master appointed by the Lord Deputy, except in
Armagh, Dublin, Meath, and Kildare, where the Bishops
were made patrons. The foundation was Scriptural and
Protestant, for the Elizabethans could not understand the
possible permanence of any but the State religion. Henry
VIII.&#8217;s system of parochial schools having never come into
being, this must be considered as the first attempt at national
education. Salaries were to be fixed by the Lord Deputy,
but paid by the clergy, one-third by the ordinary, and two-thirds
by the general body. The results of the diocesan
schools, as they came to be called, fell far short of what some
expected, and it is probable that in many dioceses they were
never founded at all. But Sidney&#8217;s measure was well meant,
and was not entirely inoperative like the mediæval attempts
at Irish universities. A Bill to compel the residence of
spiritual persons was thrown out by the Commons, as well as
one to abolish the extortionate demand of meat and drink;
the majority of members probably having a personal interest
in supporting the old abuse in either case. A Bill for limiting
interests which had been acquired by lessees in entailed
property was also thrown out, the real object of it being to
restore to Ormonde those lands of his family which had been
improvidently alienated. Sidney did not oppose the measure,
but foresaw that it would fail. He was ready to do what he
could to meet Ormonde&#8217;s views, but only so far as was
consistent with ordinary process of law. &#8216;If the gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
that have lands of his in the English Pale, in fee farm and
otherwise, do not consent in all points to his lordship&#8217;s liking,
having law on their side, I cannot use compulsory means to
wrest justice, nor, I hope, it is not required in my place.&#8217;
Wise words, but it would have been better for Sidney&#8217;s reputation
had he been equally careful in guarding prescriptive
rights against Sir Peter Carew.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Commercial

Monopolies.</div>

<p>The Butlers having returned to their right mind, and
Fitzmaurice being reduced to wandering with a few followers,
Sidney busied himself chiefly with the affairs of the North.
His marvellous power of despatching causes, his extraordinary
knowledge of Irish septs and alliances, and his untiring industry,
were the theme of general admiration; and the lightning
rapidity of his movements struck terror into Irish hearts.
Before he could bring the Northern chiefs to any settlement
offering a chance of permanence, he had to hold two more
sessions of Parliament, and to make arrangements for the
Presidency of Munster, as he had already done for Connaught.
The legislation attempted was chiefly commercial.
Thus a Bill, which was at first thrown out in the Lower House
by an effort of untutored common sense, was pressed successfully
forward by the Government, who thought it important
that the ancient staple commodities wool and wool-fells, raw or
manufactured, wax, and butter, should not be exported except
by the merchants of the staple towns. Such exportation had
been already restrained by duties with a view of encouraging
Irish manufactures, but the law had not answered expectation,
having had the natural result of throwing the trade into
French, Scotch, Spanish, and other foreign hands. Instead
of repealing the Act which had done so much harm, the true
protectionist policy of further restraint was adopted. Manufactured
articles, to which linen yarn was added, might be
exported by the merchants of the staple at Dublin, Drogheda,
Cork, and Waterford, and by the merchants of other borough
towns, on paying the custom; and all power of dispensing
with the law was taken away from the Irish Government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
The raw material had continued to be exported to some
extent, but the intention to benefit Irish manufactures by
forcibly retaining it was again recorded, and infringement of
the monopoly was made felony; the Government being in
this case also declared incapable of dispensing with the Act.
It was soon discovered that trade could not be forced in this
way, and the Queen was besieged by applications for patents,
the projectors pretending to cure the evils of one monopoly
by creating another. Lancashire and Cheshire had benefited
much by Irish yarn, 4,000 hands being employed in weaving it
at Manchester alone. The embargo, it was urged, had nearly
ruined Manchester, and had not benefited Ireland, where the
weavers were few, and the people naturally given to idleness;
spinning, of course, requiring no industry. It was admitted
that the lack of lawful outlet for the cloth had something
to say to the want of weavers, but as the suitors for
patents were Englishmen, that side of the question was not
pressed.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Elizabeth, no doubt for some valuable consideration,
granted a patent to one Thomas Moore to export 3,000 packs
of linen yarn from Ireland in five years. The Corporations
of Dublin and Drogheda objected on the grounds that Ireland
did not produce 600 packs a year, that Moore was to pay
them no custom, that many men in Ireland had sunk their
substance in setting up looms on the faith of a very recent
statute, and that if the Queen persevered they would all be
ruined. She then reduced the amount to 200 packs a year;
but Irish vested interests were unappeased, and seven of the
most eminent Queen&#8217;s counsel in Dublin were very clearly
of opinion that letters patent were waste paper as against
an Act of Parliament. In the end Tremayne effected a
compromise, of which the terms are not stated, between the
patentee and the municipalities of Dublin and Drogheda,
and the latter prayed Burghley to intercede with her Majesty
against the passing of any such patents in future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dutch

<p>The intercession was not successful, for in 1578 Lord
Chancellor Gerrard obtained a similar monopoly, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
assigned to one Middlemore. Both patentee and assignee
had disputes with Dublin and Drogheda, their evident object
being to be bought off as dearly as possible. &#8216;I caused to
plant,&#8217; said Sidney, &#8216;above forty families of the reformed
churches of the Low Countries, flying thence for religion&#8217;s sake,
in one ruinous town called Swords. It would have done any
man good to see how diligently they wrought, how they re-edified
the spoiled old castle and repaired almost all the
same, and how goodly and cleanly they and their wives and
children lived. They made diaper and ticks for beds and
other good stuff for man&#8217;s use, and excellent good leather of
deer skins, goat- and sheep-fells, as is made in Southwark.&#8217;
And he spoke with becoming indignation of the infringement
of a law which he had caused to be made for the benefit of
Ireland, and which he had restrained himself and his predecessors
from contravening. In the forgotten story of these
monopolies we have a foreshadowing of Wood&#8217;s halfpence,
and it is possible that the Drapier was not ignorant of the
precedent.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir John
Perrott,
President
of Munster,
1571.</div>

<p>Sir John Perrott, of an ancient Pembrokeshire family, but
supposed by some to be a son of Henry VIII., was the person
selected for the task of reducing Munster. He had been
made a Knight of the Bath along with Ormonde at Edward
VI.&#8217;s coronation, had served at St. Quentin, and in 1560 had
again been the Earl&#8217;s companion in the tilt at Greenwich,
where, in presence of the French ambassador, he maintained
Elizabeth&#8217;s quarrel against all comers. In running a course
with Mr. Cornwallis both riders lost their tempers and fell to
tilting in the Queen&#8217;s presence with sharp lances and without
armour&mdash;a pastime which she soon put a stop to. The story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
is characteristic of the gallant but imprudent man who played
so great a part in Irish history. His taste and magnificence,
perhaps his extravagance, may be guessed from his additions
to Carew Castle&mdash;a manor which had been granted to him
by Mary in spite of his Protestantism and of his refusal to
persecute other Protestants. Ormonde now declared that his
old comrade should be Lord President even against his will,
and to judge by the delay he was neither anxious for the
honour nor in a hurry to begin the work.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Perrott&#8217;s
instructions.</div>

<p>The salary of the Lord President was fixed at 133<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,
as in the case of Connaught, and he was allowed thirty horse
and twenty foot in the Queen&#8217;s pay. The first Chief Justice,
with a salary of 100<i>l.</i>, was James Dowdall, afterwards Chief
Justice of the Queen&#8217;s Bench. Nicholas Walshe, afterwards
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, was second justice, with a
salary of 100 marks. Thomas Burgate was the first Clerk of
the Council, which originally consisted of the Archbishops and
Bishops of Munster and of the Earls of Ormonde, Thomond,
and Clancare, power being reserved to the Lord Deputy to
appoint additional councillors at his pleasure. The Council
had all the judicial authority of a Court of Assize. The Lord
President was not to be out of his province for more than six
days without the Deputy&#8217;s license; but special leave was
given to Sir John Perrott to visit his estate in Pembrokeshire
and to return within one month. The liberties of
Tipperary were not to be needlessly infringed, but those of
Kerry were declared to be null and void. The Lord President
and Council were to assist all officers, civil and ecclesiastical,
to maintain their proper authority, and the following curious
provision was made in furtherance of religion as by law
established:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;The said Lord President shall have and retain one
chaplain or minister that shall and can preach and read the
Homilies; who shall be allowed his diets in the household
of the said Lord President, and shall receive the entertainment
of one of the house assigned to the President; to whom
the Lord President shall cause due reverence to be given, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
respect of the office that he shall have for the service of
God.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Lord Deputy and Council were generally charged to
look after all the rights of the Crown in Munster, but were
not to infringe the liberty of the subject by quartering unnecessary
men on the country, the Lord Deputy and Council
being the judges of what were cases of necessity.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney goes
to England.
Sir W.
Fitzwilliam
is
Lord Justice.</div>

<p>How much Sidney hated the Irish service may be learned
from his letters, almost every one of which contains a prayer
for recall. Yet Fitzwilliam, the second string to the English
bow in Ireland, hinted that he was unwilling to retire.
Fitzwilliam always declared himself loth to accept the high
but thankless office, but both these able men may have been
more attached to power than they would confess to themselves
or to their friends. The establishment of presidencies
had been Sidney&#8217;s great panacea, and he waited only till
Munster as well as Connaught was provided for. In the
meantime he made arrangements for Northern affairs, which
under the presidency system were to be peculiarly the care
of the Lord Deputy. Tirlogh Luineach entered into a treaty
of peace with all the Queen&#8217;s subjects to be inviolably observed
until the Queen&#8217;s further pleasure should be known.
Tirlogh Luineach claimed Maguire and MacMahon as his &#8216;urraghs&#8217;;
but this the Lord Deputy refused, agreeing, however,
to give them the temporary benefit of the peace. Tirlogh
Luineach&#8217;s wife was a party to this treaty, who informed
Morton that she was the real author of it, and begged him to
support her husband&#8217;s messenger at the English Court. The
Scots were thus held in check for the time, and Sidney
further secured the Pale by an agreement with the O&#8217;Farrells,
whereby they covenanted to surrender all their lands and
receive them back from the Queen, to pay a quit rent, to
attend hostings, and to have their whole district treated as
shire ground, paying the subsidy of 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for each plough
land. O&#8217;Farrell Bane, the principal chief, is described as of
that &#8216;place called Pallas in the county of Longford,&#8217; where
Oliver Goldsmith was born.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p>Arrangements for the surrender of their lands and for
taking them back by grant were also made with MacBrien
Arra in Tipperary, and with the Kavanaghs; and Sidney,
having installed Perrott in his Presidency, and thus provided
both a scourge for the rebels and a counterpoise for Ormonde,
sailed for England, and left the government in the hands of
Sir William Fitzwilliam.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitton cannot
govern
Connaught.</div>

<p>While Ormonde was reducing the rebellious O&#8217;Briens,
Lord President Fitton was practically shut up in Galway, and
Sidney sent a force under Basnet and Collyer to relieve him.
With their help and with that of Clanricarde he was able
to besiege Shrule Castle, the key of Lower Connaught; but
Shane MacOliver Burke, claiming to be MacWilliam Iochtar,
collected the youth of Mayo and Connemara, and attacked
Fitton&#8217;s camp with great determination. He had also some
Scots mercenaries. &#8216;They resolved that if the son or kinsman
of one of them should be slain, they would not stop
with him, but pass over him at once.&#8217; The President&#8217;s Irish
and Scotch auxiliaries were driven in, and the Burkes chased
them for two miles, when the English cavalry, who had
remained in reserve, turned the tide by charging them in the
rear. Both sides claimed a victory, but the success was Fitton&#8217;s.
The Burkes retired, and the castle which they had come to
relieve was at once taken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A chieftain&#8217;s
dilemma.</div>

<p>Though badly supported by his followers, Clanricarde did
excellent service on this occasion, but Sidney was unable to
feed or arm a large force, and the victory could not be practically
followed up. Fitton could do nothing without English
soldiers, and they could not be maintained without cessing
the country. The people hardly knew how to choose between
imposts in the Queen&#8217;s name and the exactions of their own
chiefs. A poor woman complained to Shane MacOliver of
the intolerable burden of his Scots mercenaries, whereupon
&#8216;he fell into a study, and after some pause said openly, "I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
in a miserable case. If we stand out altogether and maintain
Scots for our defence, I see the destruction of the country;
again, if I shall take upon me the name of MacWilliam, I
shall be driven for maintenance thereof to spoil it myself, and
if we shall submit ourselves to the English nation, they will be
as burdensome as either MacWilliam or Scots. God give me
grace to do the likest."&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">It is doubtful
whether
English
law or Irish
custom is
best.</div>

<p>Fitton says Shane MacOliver&#8217;s speech grieved him to the
heart, for he could not deny its truth, and yet he thought the
presence of the soldiers was of some use in keeping the peace.
The country was as safe to travel, he said, as the English
Pale, but &#8216;I and my men also live most part without any
money, and they almost without clothes for lack of money.&#8217;
Peace was maintained on very precarious terms. O&#8217;Connor
Don lay in Athlone Castle as security for all his clan, but
some of his friends brought one of the light Shannon boats
or &#8216;cots&#8217; under the walls, into which he stepped and bid
farewell to his host. Fitton sallied forth next day, took and
garrisoned his chief castle of Ballintober, and declared that
that stronghold, along with Shrule and Longford, would have
to be always held. O&#8217;Connor Don and MacDermot and all
the gentlemen of Mayo were indicted, with the view of entitling
the Queen to the northern half of Connaught; and
Clanricarde&#8217;s sons were indicted also. But the O&#8217;Connors,
having got their chief out of prison, cared nothing for the
lawyers, and ranged the country at will. Their men, who
between Scots and natives were not less than 1,000, never
showed themselves except when numerically superior. Mr.
Moore, lieutenant to Captain Maltby, was wounded in a
skirmish, and sixty-four of his troopers deserted; very naturally,
considering the way in which they were treated. They
seem to have made their way to Dublin, where Fitzwilliam
punished a few, and persuaded the rest to return. In surrendering
the sword, Sidney had not the satisfaction of seeing
his favourite project of presidencies entirely successful.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

report on
Ireland.</div>

<p>Among countless reports on the state of Ireland, one by
Edmund Tremayne, who had been acting as Sidney&#8217;s secretary,
deserves particular notice. In general, he says, the
people had no conscience, but committed crimes freely; and
they had so little morality that they even changed wives
among themselves. Bridges were falling down, churches were
roofless, and no new charities had replaced the old monastic
ones. Good schools there were none, for no teacher could be
sure of being paid. In the law everything was jobbed by
certain families, and even the judicial bench was filled with
unlearned men. Bills were therefore badly drafted, justice
was thwarted, and there was general hostility to reform.
Bad in Dublin, matters were worse in the country, where
courts of quarter sessions, courts leet, and courts baron
existed only in theory. Every lord hated the restraints of
law, and made himself an Irish chief. English officials were
no better, and there was little apparent difference between
a seneschal and a native captain, disorders being as great
among English soldiers as among Irish kernes and gallowglasses.
All Englishmen made parties among the Irish, and
everything tended to go daily from bad to worse. &#8216;An
excellent, unspotted character,&#8217; said Archbishop Loftus, &#8216;is
a rare thing in this realm.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ormonde in
Kerry.
Kilmallock
an abode of
wolves.</div>

<p>While Perrott was preparing to enter upon his long and
arduous career of Irish service Ormonde made a winter
journey into Kerry, where there were rumours of a French
descent. About the time of the Lord President&#8217;s landing
Fitzmaurice, who had been lurking about Tipperary with
less than 120 &#8216;naked villains afoot,&#8217; suddenly appeared at
the head of a considerable but almost unarmed force, surprised
and burned Kilmallock. Again there was suspicion
of collusion, for he only killed two of the townsmen, and
against those two he had a personal grudge. But the native
annalists say the plunder was great, and they speak in a
way which shows how insecure was Irish life. Plate, they
state, was taken, &#8216;and jewels which the father would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
have acknowledged to his heir or the mother to her daughter
on the day before.&#8217; The same writer says that Kilmallock
became an abode of wolves, and Perrott advised that the
Queen should give 200<i>l.</i> to induce the miserable people to
return.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Butlers
again do
good service.</div>

<p>Ormonde might have saved the town but for Sir Thomas
Roe Fitzgerald, who sent him word to guard Dungarvan and
Youghal. Considering what afterwards happened to Youghal,
the advice of Sir Thomas may have been honest enough, and
Fitzmaurice was not likely to make him his confidant; but
Ormonde could think of nothing but treason in any member
of the rival House. Later on, when Fitzmaurice had killed
four of Sir Thomas&#8217;s men, the Earl was more inclined to
blame his ally for folly than for infidelity; in any case, he
pronounced him useless. He inspected the walls of Youghal
and found them weak defences, the circuit being too great
to be held by less than 300 men, and the townsmen too
poor to support such a garrison. He left them the few men
they asked for, and made arrangements for mounting what
guns they had, but complained that they were too careless of
their own security. Kilmallock deserved to be punished for
its negligence or worse; but Edward Butler recovered great
part of the cattle, and, eager to earn his pardon, pursued
Fitzmaurice, and &#8216;killed one of his dear foster brethren.&#8217;
Ormonde himself travelled on foot all over the Aherlow
forest, but none of the rebels would even skirmish, and it
was evident that Munster could only be reduced by the
steady pressure of a regular force. Believing that Sidney
would lay the blame for the loss of Kilmallock on him,
Ormonde drew the attention of the Home Government to the
fact that he had relieved Youghal, and was holding castles in
Thomond and elsewhere for the Queen at his own expense,
that he had neither English soldiers nor provisions allowed
him, and that his own country was defenceless while he was
occupied in the public service.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Perrott&#8217;s
first campaigns.
Great
hardships.</div>

<p>Having taken the oath before Sidney in Dublin, Perrott
went to Cork, where he found himself at the head of about
700 men, 200 of which were Irish. From Cork he went
to Kilmallock, where he lodged in a half-burned house, and
issued a proclamation to the townsmen to return and repair
their walls and buildings, which in course of time they did.
He then pursued the rebels, whom he came up with at
Knocklong. The Irish fled into the bogs, whither Perrott&#8217;s
soldiers followed them barefooted, carrying light cavalry
lances instead of pikes. They returned with a trophy of fifty
heads, with which the Lord President decorated the market-cross
at Kilmallock for the edification of those citizens of
Limerick who had complained of losing their goods. Lord
Roche&#8217;s cattle were restored to him, and Perrott, having
made Kilmallock defensible, marched towards Limerick. A
castle belonging to the Burkes of Clanwilliam blocked his
way, but part of the wall fell after three hours&#8217; mining, and
the chief&#8217;s wife then surrendered. Thomond, O&#8217;Shaughnessy,
and Sir Thomas of Desmond came to him at Limerick, and
he then went to Cashel. His march was again impeded by
a castle, which he took &#8216;by shooting of fire up into the top,
which was covered with thatch.&#8217; The blaze and the noise of
the falling roof frightened his picketed horses&mdash;he had about
200 mounted men&mdash;who broke loose and ran off into the woods,
where they were caught by the rebels, and in some cases
not recovered. At Cashel he hanged seven Gray merchants
for supplying the enemy with provisions, the chief magistrate
of the town hardly escaping the same fate. From Cashel he
went by Fethard and Clonmel to Ormonde&#8217;s house at Carrick,
and thence by Lismore to Cork, taking the strong castle of
Mocollop on the way. At Cork the President was attended
by Clancare and Thomond, who had now made up their minds
as to which was the strongest side, by Lords Barry, Roche,
and Courcy, and by MacCarthy Reagh and Sir Cormac MacTeige.
The White Knight&#8217;s country was again invaded, his
castles taken, and himself driven into the woods. The Glen of
Aherlow was then entered without much result, and after a few
days&#8217; rest at Cork Perrott marched against the MacSwineys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
The style of warfare may be gathered from his biographer&#8217;s
words. &#8216;He slew many of the rebels, and hanged as many
as he might take, whom the Marshal executed always as he
went along; so that they took a great prey, spoiled all the
enemy&#8217;s country, and with continual travel wore out all their
provisions, having no corn in the country left to make their
bread, which the President himself wanted for divers days, their
chief sustenance being the milk of those kine that they had
taken.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perrott&#8217;s
personal
behaviour.</div>

<p>The hardships of such warfare must have been very great,
Ormonde recommending Captain Warde and his men to
special consideration for doing such winter service as was
never done by soldiers; service from which they returned
bare-footed and bare-bodied. Their sad plight grieved him
to the heart, but he could do nothing for them. The Lord
President did not spare himself. On one occasion his foot
hurt him as he was struggling through a bog in pursuit of
the rebels. &#8216;My Lord,&#8217; said an officer, &#8216;you have lost your
shoe.&#8217; &#8216;It matters not,&#8217; said Perrott, &#8216;as long as the legs last
we shall find shoes&#8217;; and he called for another pair, and
trudged on again. Another day some gallowglasses roasted
a hog whole with the hair on, &#8216;and in great kindness did
reach a piece of it to one of the Lord President&#8217;s servants,
being a gentleman of good sort, and a justice of the peace
in his county.&#8217; Perrott made a jocular remark about the
quality of the meat. &#8216;An&#8217; it please you, sir,&#8217; said the other,
&#8216;it is good meat here among these men, but if it were at home
I would scarce give it to my dogs.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzmaurice
still holds
out.</div>

<p>Want of provisions was the great difficulty: all peaceable
men having been robbed of their cows and horses. The
MacSheehy and MacSwiney kerne swarmed everywhere, and
just as Fitzmaurice appeared to be at his last gasp, he
managed suddenly to collect a strong force of these idlemen,
obliging the Geraldines to provide for their maintenance.
Many of the native lords sympathised with him, being afraid
of losing their captainries, and they gave him information.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Perrott was never strong enough to divide his own force, and
his light-heeled adversary roamed at will from Aherlow to
Castlemaine, and from Glenflesk to Baltimore. No one was
safe for a moment. Thus Miler Magrath, the Queen&#8217;s Archbishop
of Cashel, having ventured to arrest two friars for
preaching against the Queen&#8217;s policy, Fitzmaurice ordered
their release. The poor friars, he said, preached the Word
of God to people blinded with ignorance for years for want of
good pastors, and the light of salvation, by reason of long
obscurity, was much needed in Ireland. If they were not
released all houses and buildings belonging to the Archbishop
should be burned to ashes. The letter which contained this
wise and sober advice, as the Geraldine leader called it,
finished with an invocation of the Blessed Virgin, and there
could be no doubt about the danger of the Church as established
by law. Edward Butler rescued the friars to show his
power, and perhaps to establish communications with the
Archbishop, and then offered to pursue Fitzmaurice with all
his might upon condition of pardon. Magrath and the
Dublin officials advised that, though Butler deserved ten
deaths, it would nevertheless be better to accept his offer.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Perrott
fails to

An English

<p>To the possession of Castlemaine Perrott attached great
importance, and extensive preparations were made for besieging
it. The cannon were delayed by storms on their
passage from Limerick. The castle, which stood on arches
in the water, proved stronger than was supposed, and all the
powder was expended without making a breach; there were
at the time only three cwt. in Dublin. In want of almost
every requisite for successful war, Perrott withdrew his
famished army after a siege of five weeks. On returning to
Cork he found that Fitzmaurice had not been idle in his
absence. Captain John Morgan, who was to have co-operated
with the President by sea, seeing the rebels driving cattle
along the shores of Cork harbour, landed and rescued them, and
followed the foragers till they reached their supports. Seeing
the English sailors, whose behaviour, as Ormonde said, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
more like that of ignorant beasts than of trained soldiers, at
a safe distance from their boats, Fitzmaurice attacked them
vigorously, drove them into a ruined church, and overwhelmed
them with showers of stones. Thirty-three were thus ignobly
slain; only two prisoners were taken, and these were sent
back. In consequence of this disaster, the ships which
should have supplied the besiegers of Castlemaine lay idly
at anchor.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">FOREIGN INTRIGUES.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzmaurice
wishes to
make it a
religious
war.</div>

<p>No doubt Fitzmaurice was encouraged in his seemingly
desperate task by the hope of succour from France or Spain.
The fear of losing their lands bound the Irish chiefs and
nobles together, but that would not weigh one grain with
any foreign potentate. The chiefs were doubtless with few
exceptions Catholics, but that alone would not have tempted
them to incur the penalties of treason any more than it
tempted Protestants like Cecil or Perrott to conspire against
Queen Mary. Sir Edmund Butler fought against Sir Peter
Carew, but not against the Queen. The Desmonds and their
allies fought against the St. Legers and Grenvilles and against
their hereditary foes of the House of Ormonde. The O&#8217;Neills
feared schemes of colonisation: if the Queen would let them
alone they asked for no other sovereign. Purely Irish
interests were sure to be sacrificed by France, Spain, and
Rome; but Catholicism was an inheritance in which they all
shared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Catholics
at Louvain.</div>

<p>Fitzmaurice therefore lost no opportunity of giving the
struggle a religious character, and there were plenty of
abuses in Ireland calculated to scandalise the devout as well
as to give a handle to those who were actuated only by
worldly motives. Irish priests at Louvain, often men of
honesty and virtue, took care to tell English travellers that
the Lord Deputy had one archbishopric and two bishoprics
in farm, Cashel for 40<i>l.</i>, the others for less; that the revenues
of one see supported the grand falconer, and those of another
the clerk of the kitchen&mdash;&#8216;sufficient parsons no doubt to
have such cure of Irish souls as the English doctrine will
permit them to have at this day.&#8217; The deanery of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Patrick&#8217;s was appropriated to the support of the Great Seal,
much to the disgust of the Chancellor Weston, a pious and
conscientious man, who saw the abuse clearly enough. The
parsonage of Dungarvan was assigned for the maintenance of
the Lord President. Laymen were appointed to ecclesiastical
dignities. English Jesuits who found their way to Ireland
could report these things on the Continent, adding that
Sidney&#8217;s gentleness did their cause more harm than any
severity could have done.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign
rumours.</div>

<p>Fitzmaurice was a sincere enthusiast, and no doubt he
thought that the Queen&#8217;s misdeeds and excommunication
would bring about a crusade; but the days of Boniface were
past, and little help was vouchsafed, though rumours filled
the air. A messenger from Spain touched at Cork Beg at
the mouth of Cork Harbour, where he left news for the
seneschal, and then went on to join Fitzmaurice in the Aherlow
woods. He reported that a great fleet was coming to
Dingle. Some ships from Brest and Morlaix did visit that
secluded haven, but only to carry off Fitzmaurice&#8217;s son, who
set quietly to work to seek recruits in Brittany. About thirty
years before Peter Strozzi had proposed to make a Calais on
some Irish island; this plan was now revived, but probably
Delacroix reported against it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A suspicious
Spaniard.</div>

<p>There was much trade between Spain and the west of
Munster, the foreigners carrying away fish, beef, hides, and
tallow in exchange for wine and sometimes for arms. Don
Juan de Mendoza came in a ship belonging to John Hawkins,
and by his charming manner at first disarmed Sidney&#8217;s
suspicion; but a penniless Italian adventurer&mdash;a Lucchese
named Josefo&mdash;informed him that the Biscayan hidalgo had
been sent by Alva to excite an insurrection in Ireland.
Josefo managed to get hold of the Spaniard&#8217;s letters, but the
packet was so sealed as to defy tampering. The Italian, who
was known for his attachment to the Queen of Scots, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
was perhaps a double traitor, offered to go to Alva for the
purpose of getting information. Sidney, at Mendoza&#8217;s request,
licensed Josefo to go to France. His route necessarily
lay through England, and the Lord Deputy sent Cecil
word that he might waylay him there and detain him or
not as he thought fit. Fitzwilliam, more cautious than
Sidney, objected to any foreigner becoming acquainted with
Ireland as Mendoza had done; and in this he was probably
right. The Spaniard protested his innocence, and affected to
be aggrieved by a detention of eighteen months, while speaking
in high terms of Sidney&#8217;s and of Gilbert&#8217;s courtesy. Yet
Fitzwilliam&#8217;s caution was evidently more to Burghley&#8217;s
taste, for three German counts who had a mind to visit
Ireland a year or two later received introductions accompanied
by secret instructions to show them nothing which could
decently be concealed.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Archbishop
Fitzgibbon
on the
Continent,
1571.</div>

<p>Foreign powers, however, were not likely to want information,
for Fitzmaurice sent Maurice Reagh Fitzgibbon, the
papal Archbishop of Cashel, to Philip. Fitzgibbon went
from Spain to Bordeaux, where the Bishop presented him
with a good horse to ride during his stay. He told certain
Youghal merchants that he was come to seek help from the
French King, and was allowed openly to rig ships and to
press men. The Guises sent emissaries to keep Ireland
disturbed, and the appearance of a fleet under the Duke of
Medina Celi was the appointed signal for a general rising.
A combined invasion by French and Spaniards was looked
for daily, and one of Burghley&#8217;s spies, a Catholic by birth
and in constant communication with the Bishop of Ross,
obtained accurate information as to the hopes of the papal
party in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Irish
Catholics.</div>

<p>The gentry of the Pale and of the greater part of Leinster
were Catholics at heart, looking for an opportunity to throw
off the mask. In Ulster all were ardent Catholics, banded
together under the influence of the Jesuit David Wolfe,
whose orders, issued from his prison in Dublin Castle, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
generally obeyed. All Connaught was anti-English. In the
Desmond half of Munster all were Catholics and confederates,
who expected a large army from Spain and France, in which
latter country Thomond had sowed good seed. Ormonde,
indeed, was unnaturally loyal, but that was the only dark spot.
The Ulster, Connaught, and Munster bishops were Catholics;
those of Leinster only Protestant. The Northern clergy
looked to Raymond O&#8217;Gallagher, Bishop of Derry, who had
lately returned from Rome with a large budget of orders; the
Southern waited on the word of Maurice Reagh Fitzgibbon,
who was already in Spanish pay, and who was the head and
front of the whole conspiracy.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzgibbon&#8217;s
account
of
Catholic
Ireland.</div>

<p>The case of the Catholic confederates can best be told
in Fitzgibbon&#8217;s own words. In recommending his suit to
Philip and to the Pope, he recited the fidelity of Ireland to
the Holy See during the 1,127 years which had elapsed since
the time of St. Patrick and Pope Celestine, and then continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;Notwithstanding that for fifty years they have been very
often sorely provoked, molested, and afflicted by divers schisms,
errors, and heresies of the unstable and restless sect and
nation of the kingdom of England, yet has God&#8217;s clemency
preserved all your people firm and steadfast in their accustomed
Catholic faith, obedience, and devotion, and has
inspired them not to acquiesce in the errors propounded to
them.</p>

<p>&#8216;Your Holiness and your Catholic Majesty must know
that all the nobility and the entire people of that kingdom
wish to walk as usual in the footsteps of their forefathers,
and to remain firm, steadfast, and constant in the same faith
and unity of the Catholic Church, and to persevere to the
death in perpetual obedience and devotion to the supreme
Pontiffs and to the Apostolic See. They hate and abhor
sects and heresies so much, that they prefer to leave their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
homes and go abroad rather than to live under heretics, or
to acquiesce in the errors and restlessness of the English,
who, in the last schism under Henry VIII. and Edward VI.,
plundered and devastated the churches and monasteries of
Ireland, proscribed and afflicted Catholic bishops and religious
persons, and threw the whole population into the greatest
confusion. This Queen Elizabeth has revived the tragedy,
and has imprisoned the chief bishops and other religious
persons of the kingdom for their perseverance in the faith
and their Catholic obedience, and throughout the whole island
has executed the policy of her father and brother with the
greatest determination and vigour, sending new preachers
and heretical bishops with great store of heretical books to
be circulated among the people. Wherefore the people of
that kingdom with all humility pray God without ceasing
that He will pity their calamities and end their afflictions,
and that He will condescend so to inspire the minds of his
Holiness and of the most clement Catholic King, that they
may be pleased to make it their immediate care that that
people, devoted as it is to God, to his Holiness, and to his
Catholic Majesty, shall not be contaminated and destroyed
by the accursed and contagious heresy which flourishes in
England.</p>

<p>&#8216;Your Holiness and your Catholic Majesty must know
that it has long been, and now is, the highest desire of the
nobility and all the people of that kingdom to come absolutely
under the patronage and protection of his Holiness,
and of the most clement and Catholic King of Spain, to
whom all men of position and property in that island look
directly for the means of avoiding the affliction and danger
of the heresy and schism in the ever-changing kingdom of
England. They have, therefore, deliberately resolved, with
God&#8217;s help and the favour of the most clement Catholic
King, to accept the person of any active Catholic Prince of
his Catholic Majesty&#8217;s blood, whether of the Spanish or Burgundian
branch, specially appointed by him for the purpose,
and to receive him and crown him as their true, legitimate,
and natural King, and thus to re-establish in perpetuity the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
royal throne of that island,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and to venerate the presence of
one King, one faith, and one kingdom, the donation of that
island having been first obtained from and confirmed by
the Apostolic See. Thus they hope to remain henceforth
for ever in their accustomed obedience and devotion to
the supreme Pontiff, and in union with the Holy Catholic
Mother Church of Christ, and in their pristine friendship
and alliance with the Royal House of Spain, from which
nation the whole nobility of that kingdom derived its
origin.</p>

<p>&#8216;Not without cause do all the states of that island most
strongly desire this, since that kingdom in extent, in its
temperate climate, in its fertility, and in its wealth, might
well vie with the kingdom of England, if only it were ruled
justly and piously by a religious resident Catholic Prince or
royal head. They all in general detest the tyrannous and inconstant
yoke of the English State, and still more its heresies,
with which they desire to have nothing in common, except
neighbourliness and Christian love.</p>

<p>&#8216;Underwritten are the names of those prelates, chiefs,
barons, and nobles who are thus well-disposed towards the
Holy Apostolic See, and that most potent prince the Lord
Philip, King of all the Spains.&#8217; Then follows a list of all
the nobles, prelates, chiefs, and towns in Ireland who were
prepared to promote Spanish interests in their country,
&#8216;together with those of many English residents in the
island.&#8217; The Archbishop urged Philip to seize at once all
Irish forts and harbours, a proceeding which the English
were in no condition to prevent. &#8216;Success,&#8217; he said, &#8216;altogether
depends on celerity, for your Majesty will be able to
do with 10,000 men and a little expense what you will not
afterwards be able to accomplish with 100,000 men and all
available power.&#8217; We know from other sources how weak
the English Government was at this time, and how difficult
it would have been to dislodge even 5,000 Spaniards; but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
ask Philip to do anything quickly was as vain as speaking to
the winds or writing upon the running water.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzgibbon
too sanguine.
Philip II.
hesitates.</div>

<p>Yet Fitzgibbon certainly did not underrate the importance
to Spain of an Irish alliance. Few will think that the
resources of Ireland were at any time equal to those of
England. Of the twelve prelates whom he enumerates not
more than three or four were in a condition to give an invader
material help. Among the six Earls whom he mentions
Desmond was a prisoner in England, Ormonde a loyal subject
of Queen Elizabeth, and Clanricarde at least not actively
disloyal. There was no Earl of Tyrone. Thomond and
Clancare were ready enough both to rebel and to submit
when pressed. The Irish chiefs were all Catholics no doubt,
but nothing like continuous combined action could be expected
from clans who had from time immemorial been
fighting against each other. From the chartered towns a
Catholic prince might expect much sympathy, but very little
open aid; England had always been strong enough to punish
them. Forty years before, Charles V., after a careful investigation,
had made up his mind that the Desmonds could
not be maintained against the Tudors, and the more he
learned about the matter the less likely was Philip to disagree
with his father&#8217;s opinions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas
Stukeley.</div>

<p>Some account must now be given of one of the most
extraordinary adventurers which even the England of the
sixteenth century produced. Thomas Stukeley, a gentleman
belonging to an old English family in North Devon, having
run through his younger brother&#8217;s portion by riotous living
while in the Duke of Suffolk&#8217;s retinue, sought after his
patron&#8217;s death to enrich himself at the expense of others.
Claiming a legacy from another West-countryman, Serjeant
Prideaux, he broke into the testator&#8217;s house and searched his
coffers in spite of an injunction to the contrary. He tried
piracy for a while, and was imprisoned in the Tower at the
suit of an Irish gentleman whom he had robbed. His friends
managed to procure his enlargement, and he soon persuaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the only daughter and heiress of Alderman Curtis to marry
him. When his father-in-law died he spent his money in
every kind of dissipation. If a balladmonger of the day may
be believed, he squandered 100<i>l.</i> a day, selling at last the
blocks of tin with which the Alderman, probably a Cornishman
or Devonian, had paved the yard of his London house.
When all was gone he deserted his wife.</p>

<div class="poetry-block"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Make much of me, dear husband,&#8217; she did say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8216;I&#8217;ll make much more of thee,&#8217; said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8216;Than any one shall, verily:&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so he sold her clothes, and went his way.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>His magnificent patronage had been extended to travellers,
one of whom dedicated to him a description of the countries
bordering on the Baltic, and, like other Devon men, he
looked to the sea as to his native element. The Queen
licensed him to found a colony in Florida, and he promised
in his usual vein of braggadocio to write to her &#8216;in the style
of princes, to our dearest sister.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stukeley&#8217;s
adventures.
He goes to
Spain.</div>

<p>The Queen directed Sussex to give his flotilla shelter
in the Irish ports, and from that time he is connected
more or less closely with the history of Ireland. He
had made friends with Shane O&#8217;Neill during his residence
in London. Stukeley never went to Florida, but with a
ship of 400 tons, containing 100 tall soldiers besides
mariners, he appeared upon the coast of Munster in his true
character of pirate. &#8216;I fear,&#8217; said Sir Thomas Wrothe, &#8216;he
will make the sea his Florida. He hath been reached at to
be catched, but it will not be yet.&#8217; Caught he was at last,
and in great danger of hanging, for Elizabeth was very angry
at his piracies; but Shane O&#8217;Neill wrote on behalf of his old
acquaintance, professing to believe it quite impossible that he
could have done anything against Queen or laws. Even
Arnold was captivated, or perhaps was determined to see
things in the same light as Shane. At all events, Stukeley
found some favour, for he was allowed to enter into recognisances
as to the charges of piracy, and to go back to Ireland
with recommendations from Cecil, Leicester, and Pembroke.
Sidney not only showed him favour, but at Shane&#8217;s own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
request employed the desperate adventurer as a go-between,
and the success of the negotiations was such as might have
been expected from the diplomatist&#8217;s character. Stukeley
next persuaded Sir N. Bagenal to sell him his office of
Marshal and his lands in Ireland for 3,000<i>l.</i> Irish. Sidney
was inclined to sanction the bargain, but the notion of
Stukeley being employed in such an office was much disliked
in England. Cecil did not approve of it, and the Lord
Deputy had gently to remind him that he had himself
written in Stukeley&#8217;s favour. Elizabeth, who seems to have
correctly judged the adventurer&#8217;s character, railed at him in
good set terms, would not hear of his appointment, and
ordered him to be sent home to answer the charges made
against him in the Admiralty Court. Those who love to
depreciate Elizabeth should remember how well she saw
through the specious villain who deceived Burghley, Sidney,
and Philip. It is likely enough that Stukeley would never
have paid Bagenal. Had he found the 3,000<i>l.</i> it would probably
have been either the profits of piracy or a bribe from
Shane O&#8217;Neill. He neither returned to England nor gave up
his evil courses, being soon afterwards in trouble for buying
stolen goods from pirates. Sidney remained his friend, and
placed him in temporary possession of the seneschalship of
Wexford, vacant first by the absence and then by the death
of Sir Nicholas Heron; but the Queen was obdurate, and the
coveted office was given to Nicholas White, against whom
Stukeley immediately began to intrigue, representing the
successful candidate as a creature of Ormonde and an enemy
to the Lord Deputy. He was rash enough to say that he did
not care a straw for the Queen or her office, and finding his
powers for mischief too limited in Ireland, and himself in
danger of arrest, he went to Spain and offered his services to
Philip. Mendoza assured Cecil that he knew nothing about
this journey, but of course his statement was not believed.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Stukeley
and Fitzgibbon
in
Spain.</div>

<p>Knowing Stukeley&#8217;s antecedents, it is extraordinary that
Sidney should have taken no pains to stop him, and should
have believed that he and his motley following were going to
London to see the Queen. Stukeley had already been some
time in communication with Spain, and it is impossible to
believe that Sidney was privy to his designs; but it is hard
to understand the treatment he received.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English
and Irish

<p>He was allowed to purchase the &#8216;Trinity,&#8217; of Bridgewater,
and to spend five weeks at Waterford waiting for a wind and
lading a cargo of malt, wheat, beans, and fourteen horses.
The crew consisted of twenty-eight men, English and Irish
except one Italian named Alessandro Fideli: only Fideli and
the pilot knew the ship&#8217;s destination. A run of five days
brought them to Vivero, in Galicia, whence Stukeley sent
Fideli and Raymond Digby to the King at Seville. Archbishop
Fitzgibbon afterwards informed Philip that many of
Stukeley&#8217;s company were in despair when they found themselves
in Spain, not daring to go back to England or Ireland,
and destitute of resources. &#8216;He threatens them in case they
attempt to return to their country or go elsewhere to put
them in prison or something worse&mdash;that is, to throw them
into the sea, for they are in his ship, as he treated others on
a former occasion. Your Majesty can be well informed of
all this by the same Irishmen who are here or in Galicia on
this condition, that the same Thomas Stukeley be never told
who gave the information; for on other terms they will
never tell the truth, fearing this man, who has always been
most singularly revengeful in his wickedness.&#8217; Stukeley&#8217;s
messengers returned with 200 ducats, and Philip afterwards
sent a pursuivant with 1,000 more to bring their leader to
Madrid, where he or his son received a further sum of 3,000
ducats. Stukeley was lodged at the King&#8217;s cost, a Catalonian
knight of Calatrava, Don Francis de Merles, being assigned
to him as companion. An emissary of Cecil&#8217;s was from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
first at work to sow dissension between Stukeley and Archbishop
Fitzgibbon, who was already disliked by the Duke of
Feria. De Silva, the late ambassador in England, was
consulted as to the nature of the Irish and Scotch, and he
reported that both nations were beggarly, proud, and
traitorous. Whatever value Philip may have attached to
this opinion, he lavished favours on Stukeley, knighted him,
and gave him sums amounting to 21,000 ducats within a few
months; 500 reals a day were allowed him for table money,
and the King sent his son to Alcala to be educated in the
Prince of Orange&#8217;s company. Stukeley now called himself
Duke of Ireland, and made more show than any two dukes
at the Spanish Court. The Duke of Feria gave him horses
and armour, he lived splendidly in his village near Madrid,
and he was allowed to hope for a force of 10,000 men and
the twenty-six ships which had brought Philip&#8217;s queen to
Spain. Some said that an expedition under the Duke of
Medina Celi was intended for Ireland, and that the whole
island would rise as soon as his flag appeared on the coast.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rumours of
invasion.</div>

<p>In France, too, the stir among the exiles was great.
Emissaries from Alva spread a report at Paris that the Duke
was going to do something in Scotland or Ireland about
March 1571. Malicorne, who had represented France at the
marriage of the King of Spain, returned with news that Julian
Romero, an old soldier who had been wounded at St. Quentin,
had actually been despatched to Ireland with 3,000 men.
Francis Walsingham, who was beginning his great career
as ambassador at Paris, had a conversation with Charles IX.,
who told him that he hated the Guise faction and that he
supposed Queen Elizabeth did so too. Walsingham could
only repeat what he heard, but he must have been reassured
by the magnificent contempt with which his mistress treated
all these rumours. She informed him that certain savage
Irish rebels of no value had gone to Spain nominally for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
conscience sake, whereas they were of no religion, but wholly
given to bestiality. Stukeley had joined them, and tried to
make himself important by superfluously spending of other
men&#8217;s goods, he being in fact not worth a &#8216;marmaduc.&#8217; She
marvelled that king or minister should be taken in by such a
fellow, and could not believe in Julian Romero and his
invasion. It had never been her practice to employ Protestant
refugees, of which there were plenty in England, in
intrigues against their lawful sovereign, the King of Spain.
Walsingham was instructed to complain about the French
captain who brought away Fitzmaurice&#8217;s son, and he was not
to be put off with evasive answers either from the French
king or from the Spanish ambassador at Paris. The Spanish
ambassador, with a proud and disdainful countenance, denied
all knowledge of Stukeley or Romero. &#8216;They were no
Spaniards who had that enterprise in hand.&#8217; The French
King promised to punish Mons. De la Roche and the other
officers who had meddled in Irish plots; but Walsingham
believed neither of them, and advised the Queen to revenge
herself by giving trouble in Flanders. The Netherlanders
indeed tied Philip&#8217;s hands; for France was not yet a Spanish
province with Guise for viceroy, and it was impossible to
break conclusively with England until French influence in
Flanders should be no longer feared.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Philip II.&#8217;s
ideas.</div>

<p>When Stukeley arrived in Spain Archbishop Fitzgibbon
recommended him to Philip without knowing much about
him. He said he was daring and clever, that he had a
knowledge of Irish harbours and was accompanied by Irish
mariners, and that he bitterly hated his own country, to
which he could never hope to return. But Fitzgibbon, like
Rinuccini in later times, found that there was an irreconcilable
difference between English and Irish refugees. The
former were quite ready to get rid of Elizabeth, and not to
be too particular about the means; but then Mary Stuart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
must be their queen. Their Catholic England once established,
they had no more idea than Mary Tudor had of
suffering an independent Ireland, or an Ireland under foreign
sovereignty. Philip knew enough about his late wife&#8217;s
dominions to see that the lesser island would be a most
burdensome possession, and that no possible England would
ever allow him to hold it quietly. He lavished favours on
Stukeley, who was no doubt amusing and might annoy his
dear sister-in-law; but he professed ignorance as to the projector&#8217;s
plans, and perhaps never had any serious notion of
employing him against Ireland. The island was poor and
the people barbarous, and no revenue could be expected.
He had trouble enough already with the Flemings, who had
long been pouring across the Channel rather than submit to
Alva&#8217;s tyranny, enriching England and draining his own
exchequer. To invade Ireland would be to add an English
fleet to his other troubles, and very possibly to cause a
French occupation of Flanders. He is said to have contemplated
seizing the Scilly Islands, which might have been
valuable as a protection to Spanish trade; but this idea, if
ever entertained, was abandoned for similar reasons. The
Irish had offered their country to Philip to escape from England,
in the belief, perhaps, that it might be left to themselves.
Fitzgibbon saw clearly that this could never be.
Had England remained Catholic he would have preferred her
rule; now that Catholicism was proscribed he was perforce
for the Spaniard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzgibbon
thwarts
Stukeley.
The Pope
discourages
Fitzgibbon.</div>

<p>Fitzgibbon told Philip Stukeley&#8217;s very unedifying history.
At first he had recommended him as likely to be useful, but
was now convinced that he was an impostor. &#8216;I cannot,&#8217; he
said, &#8216;believe that the Irish princes would wish that a private
English gentleman should have command in the slightest
degree in their kingdom, while they with such obstinacy
resist the Queen of England, who has so often offered them
peace on good conditions. Therefore, I consider his coming
as an act of deception, or an act devoid of common sense,
for, as far as I can understand, he has received no commission
from the princes of Ireland for your Majesty or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
one else.&#8217; The adventurer retorted with charges against
the prelate&#8217;s private character, which, whether true or false,
had certainly some weight with Philip. Stukeley may have
cherished some mad idea of ruling Ireland as a Spanish
viceroy. In any case, it is likely that he ill-treated the
Irishmen who followed him, for they deserted to the Archbishop
of Cashel, who refused to give them up. The Court
were divided into two parties&mdash;Ruy Gomez, favouring the
Archbishop, and the Duke of Feria, with his English wife,
siding with Stukeley. There was a further difficulty with
the Pope, who considered Ireland his own property, and
thought Philip but a lukewarm son of the Church. It was
not so very long since Tivoli and Ostia had been occupied by
Spanish troops, and the city saved by a sort of accident.
Did not the Catholic King, the great-nephew of Catherine of
Arragon, the grandson of the great Isabella, keep the peace
with his sister-in-law, and bear patiently the many insults
of that excommunicated heretic, Anne Boleyn&#8217;s bastard
daughter? The cardinal secretary informed the zealous
Irish priest that the Pope was much surprised at his presumption
in moving in such matters without special license.
He might easily have remembered that Ireland was a fief of
the Church, and inalienable without the will of the lord.
His Holiness would do nothing unless Philip would sue to
him for a grant, and the cardinal secretary would merely
venture to guess that such a suit would not be denied. He
might, with at least equal probability, have guessed that it
never would be made.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzgibbon&#8217;s
excuses
to the
Pope.</div>

<p>Fitzgibbon was horrified at meeting opposition from Rome.
He was a fugitive, and his flock was at the mercy of wolves.
His pall had been carried off by the English heretics, and he
besought the Pope to send him another. If Ireland thought
his Holiness alone could have delivered her &#8216;from the jaws
of the English,&#8217; she would have asked no other master. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
other help was clearly necessary; France had none to give,
and no State was more orthodox than Spain, which could
alone relieve Irish Catholics. Only prompt help could avail,
for the power of England increased daily, not only in Ireland,
but in France, Flanders, Scotland, and Germany; Catholic
interests, indeed, were threatened all over Europe.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Stukeley in
Spain.
Rumours.</div>

<p>While Pius V. hesitated and procrastinated, Stukeley
swaggered about in Spain, and affected to take the interests
of English Catholicism under his protection. A certain Oliver
King, a soldier of fortune, was at Madrid, and was accused by
Stukeley of heresy; but his daily attendance at Mass, where
he &#8216;knocked his breast&#8217; devoutly, obtained for King the
advocacy of Don Francesco de Merles, and his persecutor was
unable to bring him before the Inquisition. He was, however,
stripped and banished, and was fain to pass the Pyrenees
in the snow, eluding the bravoes whom Stukeley had sent
after him. When in safety he wrote to Cecil, giving an
account of Stukeley&#8217;s proceedings, and praying God that he
might not see England as he had seen France, the land
waste, and the women at the mercy of foreign hirelings.
Traitors, he said, abounded, who gaped for Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s
death, and Stukeley boasted that he would give Ireland to
Philip. Some 4,000 desperadoes had been got together;
rascally ill-armed Bezonians, but officered by old beaten men
of war, such as Julian Romero. An expedition was expected
to sail almost immediately from Vigo, and King, who had a
knowledge of military matters and mining, eagerly offered his
services, provided the Queen would pardon him. Another
Englishman, who had been in regular correspondence with
Norris and Walsingham, was imprisoned for forty-seven days on
suspicion, and nearly died of ill-treatment. On being released
he was ordered to quit the kingdom. He agreed with King
that a descent on Ireland would take place in March or April
1571, and added that Alva had a plan to occupy Caistor and
Yarmouth.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Fitzgibbon
goes to
France,
and negotiates
with
England.</div>

<p>Finding that no expedition left Vigo, and that the King
trusted Stukeley more than him, Fitzgibbon determined to
see what he could do in France. At Bordeaux he was
received with honour by the bishop, who gave him a horse
to ride during his stay. On arriving at Paris he was at once
waited on by Captain Thomas, a native of the Pale in
the French service, who offered him such courtesies as were
in the English Ambassador&#8217;s power. He asked and received
an introduction to the Cardinal of Lorraine, to whom he
manifested his own importance and the weakness of Ireland.
Thomas, who had access to the Cardinal, let him know that
Ireland was strong enough to resist a multitude&mdash;a statement
which would have been hardly borne out by Sidney or
Fitzwilliam. With better reason the captain reminded his
Eminence that Fitzgibbon was a Geraldine, and that the
heads of that House were in prison. The Cardinal&#8217;s demeanour
then became cool, and the poor Archbishop began to
think that after all Queen Elizabeth might be his best card.
A second Irish soldier was appointed to watch him, and to
report anything of importance that he might let fall. The
Queen would not promise to restore him to his see, but was
willing to pardon him, and to give him as good a living in
Ireland. If Walsingham thought him insincere, he was to
pump every possible secret out of him, and then try to get
him given up by the French King as a rebel. The Archbishop&#8217;s
terms were a pardon under the Great Seal, restoration
to his see, and license to go back to Ireland with eight
companions; in consideration of which he was ready to be a
loyal subject, and to let her Majesty have all &#8216;news.&#8217; Being
pressed to substitute &#8216;secrets&#8217; for &#8216;news,&#8217; he said he was
very unwilling to do anything which might deprive him of a
future asylum in Spain or elsewhere. Should the Queen
think fit to restore him to his country and place&mdash;he said
nothing about the lost pall&mdash;he would show to Walsingham
in writing &#8216;both the names of the conspiracy, and also the
remedy.&#8217; But Elizabeth would not hear of his returning to
Ireland except by way of England, and he was far too wary
for that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Later
movements
of Fitzgibbon.</div>

<p>He sought an interview with Anjou, but here Captain
Thomas was before him, and told the French prince that Ireland
was poor, and only an expense to the Queen, and that
the Archbishop was of small credit, having been banished for
brawling. Monsieur then sent the exiled prelate two hundred
crowns, and said he was afraid he should not have time
to see him. Fitzgibbon seemed for a moment inclined to go
to England, and sue for pardon; but &#8216;sinister practices&#8217; prevented
this, if it had ever been seriously intended. The
Archbishop went off to Nantes and afterwards found his way
to Scotland, where he suffered imprisonment. Returning
again to the Continent, he continued to intrigue against
Elizabeth, and died at Oporto in 1578 without having effected
anything of importance. Captain Thomas continued to draw
his sixteen crowns per month from the French Government,
and received thanks from Queen Elizabeth, but she does not
seem to have conferred those substantial rewards at which
Walsingham hinted. She had conveniently discovered in the
course of the intrigue that the Archbishop was not of much
importance, and that he was no relation to the Earl of
Devon.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzwilliam
cannot govern
without
money,
1571.</div>

<p>Sidney was looked upon as the proper Viceroy for stormy
times, and to him money and troops were given grudgingly
and of necessity, for he would not go to Ireland without
them. Fitzwilliam was but a stop-gap, thrown into the
place to serve a turn, as he bitterly expressed it. &#8216;For God&#8217;s
sake,&#8217; he cried, &#8216;let me be rid of Ireland or I perish.&#8217; Arthur
Lord Grey was chosen for the perilous post, but the appointment
did not then take place, because the Queen differed from
him as to a sum of 2,000<i>l.</i> It would all, said Fitzwilliam, have
been spent in her service, and she would lose ten times the sum
by denying it. Of money, indeed, there was a most grievous
want. The magazines were empty. The captains were
almost openly mutinous. The men were in rags and ready
to desert, being forced in the meantime to sell their arms for
sheer want. The victuallers were unpaid and had struck
work. The Lord Chancellor&#8217;s salary was at least two years
in arrears. Grey was taken seriously ill at the thought of
being forced to go to Ireland on the Queen&#8217;s terms, and
Sidney positively refused to return. Fitzwilliam had therefore

<p>After his failure at Castlemaine, Perrott said that the
work of &#8216;trotting the mountains&#8217; was not suited to English
soldiers. He had been promised two hundred kerne at sixpence
a day, but had received neither the men nor the pay.
He could not do without them, even if he had to keep them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
at his own cost. The only real way of restoring order was
to be in two places at once, as Governor and as general; that
being impossible, he must have such a force as would bear
dividing. &#8216;To follow the kerne from wood to wood your
Lordship knows the soldiers are far unable. Therefore,
if I should do any good here, I must have kerne against
kerne, and gallowglass against gallowglass, and trained men
to do what they may for the stand.&#8217; Limerick, the garden of
Munster, was too much impoverished to support an army,
and the men were in dysentery from always eating beef without
bread or vegetables, not forty horsemen being fit for
service. The Privy Council, who had promised two hundred
kerne, now murmured at being asked for a bare hundred, and
the fiery President declared that he would never trust them,
nor do anything in their faith again. From Ormonde alone,
whom he &#8216;ever loved and honoured,&#8217; did he get any real help,
and he was not always satisfied that even Ormonde did his best
to prosecute the rebels, for he urged him to divide his men
into four divisions, and then to leave Fitzmaurice no resting-place.
But even while chiding the Earl for inaction, Perrott
admitted that want of provisions was a fair excuse.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>In his extremity Perrott was driven to ask that Sir John
of Desmond might be sent over. In the absence of the Earl
Sir John would then be leader of the Geraldines, and would
draw all away from James Fitzmaurice. The people of the
&#8216;poor, ruinous town of Kinsale,&#8217; as they called themselves,
begged for both brothers to help the President in saving them
from the fate of Kilmallock. They of Youghal, who had yet to
learn of what Desmond was capable, urged the same request.
They complained of being shut up within their walls, in hourly
fear of assault, and crushed by the cost of a garrison in which
they had no confidence. They were worn with watching; no
one could spend a night at home. Rich and poor were in
the same plight, and the young would soon be as weak as the
old already were. Their chance of food depended on the
precarious herring fishery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Desmond and his brother, they said, &#8216;in their time did
right well govern these parts,&#8217; and their return would send
James Fitzmaurice beyond the seas. For Sidney they longed
no less than for Desmond. Perrott was entirely against the
restoration of the Earl, thinking that his further detention
in London would secure the good behaviour of his brother.
He advised that the Earl and Countess, who were prisoners
at large, should be shut up in the Tower for a year, so as to
take away all hope of their return. This, he thought, would
encourage the Geraldine chiefs to make separate terms. Sir
John might then be safely sent over, security having been first
taken for his good behaviour. &#8216;I hear,&#8217; said Perrott, &#8216;he is
a decent gentleman.&#8217; Fitzwilliam, who saw Munster pretty
much through Ormonde&#8217;s eyes, was equally against both.
&#8216;God keep both Sir John of Desmond and base money out
of Ireland, yet are they both at the seaside to come over,
if brutes be true.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Perrott
proposes to
decide the
war by a
duel.</div>

<p>Most people who study the acts of Sir John Perrott will
probably be of opinion that he was a wise and honest man,
if not always prudent for himself. But he now indulged in
such an act of folly as can hardly be matched, even in the
annals of Irish misgovernment. He could not catch James
Fitzmaurice, and therefore he challenged him, resolving, if
possible, to end the war at one blow. Had the weapons been
those of the tilt-yard, the Queen&#8217;s old champion might have
been pretty sure of victory, but Fitzmaurice, who at first
encouraged the President&#8217;s idea, insisted upon sword and
target and Irish trousers for both sides. Perrott agreed, and
provided a pair of scarlet trousers for himself. Then Fitzmaurice
objected to single combat, and proposed that there
should be fifty a side. It was finally agreed that each party
should consist of twelve horse and twelve foot, &#8216;with indifferent
armour and weapon.&#8217; Edward Butler was one of
those picked on the President&#8217;s side. Perrott wrote to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Ormonde to borrow his horse, and begged him to attend with
all his force, evidently thinking that there was a danger of
foul play. &#8216;I trust very shortly,&#8217; he told the Earl, &#8216;to
make end of this war, and to overthrow the rest of these
Geraldines, which do so much annoy her Majesty&#8217;s subjects.
My lord, I have promised that there shall be no hurt done
unto him by any of your lordship&#8217;s men, until such time as
the day be past, and I have promised him peace, that no
man shall hurt him, nor none of his, till this matter be tried.
And so he likewise hath promised to do the like unto all her

officials, even policemen, have often been protected by the
same consideration. Perrott, however, was very angry, and
resolved to &#8216;hunt the fox out of his hole,&#8217; regretting, as
well he might, that he had wasted so much time and played
into the hands of his crafty foe.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Colonisation
of
Ulster.
Sir Thomas
Smith,
1572.</div>

<p>The failure of colonisation projects in Munster did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
prevent the Queen from listening to those who imagined that
they could found private principalities in Ireland. The district
of Ards, in what is now the County of Down, being
almost surrounded by the sea, was by its position well suited
for such an experiment. On the north-west a land frontier
of barely ten miles might seem to require no great number of
defenders. Various offers were made, those of Secretary
Smith being accepted by Elizabeth. Tremayne, who foresaw
the commotion that would be caused by any scheme of
colonisation, was in favour of a more extended experiment;
but strongly advised that the Queen should appear as the
patroness of a country already her own, and not as a conqueror.
The people should be told that their rights would
not be infringed, and this should be published everywhere
in the Irish language. Had Sir Thomas Smith taken this
advice he would still have had many difficulties to encounter;
but he did not take it, and the Ulster Irish had their first
notice from a pamphlet written in English and published in
London. Sir Thomas thought that &#8216;the little book was evil
done,&#8217; but was induced to agree to its being put forth by his
son, who was to have the actual direction of the business,
and whom he was even content to lose in the glorious work
of reconquering the Queen&#8217;s land without burden to her or to
the English State. The writer of the pamphlet, whether
young Smith or another, set forth at length the historical
reasons why the English power had waned in Ireland, and
proposed to restore it by colonisation. A permanent garrison
was to be established, and &#8216;every soldier to be made master
of his own land, to him and his heirs for ever.&#8217; It was supposed
that 600 or 700 men would be enough, and that the
penniless younger sons, who could no longer fall back on the
decent idleness of the abbeys, would seize upon this golden
opportunity. The examples chosen to prove how easily a
small English force might overcome a larger body of Irish
were singularly inapplicable to a plan of colonisation. It
was true that Gilbert with 100 men had driven the Munster
rebels before him, that Collyer with one company had discomfited
1,000 Redshanks, that Randolph with 300 had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
beaten 3,000 O&#8217;Neills before Derry. But it was equally
true that the rebels were as strong as ever when Gilbert&#8217;s
back was turned, that Scots continued to pour in, and that
the settlement at Derry was abandoned. It was argued that
300 horse and 400 foot would be enough to settle the Ards,
and their pay would amount to 10,000<i>l.</i> a year. For the
first three years they were to pay no rent for their holdings,
after which it was estimated that they would be self-supporting.
How Sir Thomas Smith could imagine that private
adventurers would lend 10,000<i>l.</i> a year without interest for
three years, upon the security of Irish land still unconquered,
may well puzzle us; but sanguine hope was a characteristic
of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>&#8216;Many shall say,&#8217; the candid pamphleteer admits, &#8216;that
they shall go into a place where they shall want meat,
housing, and all things necessary, for that no prince yet hath
been able to victual their army ... that the soldier is
always constrained to march through the bogs and rivers,
and in the night to lodge upon the grass without meat and
fire. This is indeed a great misery ... but consider the
difference that is between the Deputy&#8217;s journey who seeketh
to apprehend the rebels&#8217; bodies ... and his enterprise, who
desireth the land only.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
O&#8217;Neills are
alarmed.</div>

<p>Whatever English adventurers may have thought of
Thomas Smith and his pamphlet, there was nothing in the
movement which could possibly be pleasing to the Irish.
The Norman family of Savage had from early times enjoyed
dominion in the Ards, and their title to considerable estates
in the southern half had been acknowledged in 1559. It
was evidently not intended to interfere with them, and
though pretty thoroughly Hibernicised, they seem on the
whole to have favoured Smith&#8217;s enterprise. Had the plan
been strictly confined to the peninsula, and adequately
supported until the cultivation of wastes became profitable,
a small English Pale might have been created in Ulster.
But Sir Brian MacPhelim O&#8217;Neill, chief of a clan which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
long lorded it over the southern part of Antrim and the
northern part of Down, took fright at once. Even in the
Ards he claimed superiority, and he rightly guessed that
Smith&#8217;s operations would extend further. Old Captain Piers
at Carrickfergus promptly reminded the Lord Deputy that it
was the nature of Irishmen to let land lie idle rather than to
see others work, and that the Clandeboye O&#8217;Neills had been
too long loose to brook the curb easily. Piers circulated a
letter purporting to be a copy of one sent by the Lord
Deputy, and denying the whole story; &#8216;but the truth,&#8217; he
added, &#8216;will soon be known, in spite of my feigning.&#8217; He
advised Fitzwilliam to gain time by pretending that the intruders
were brought in entirely against the Scots, and to
take timely pledges from Sir Brian MacPhelim. He would
do his best; but when all shifts were exhausted the Irish
would revolt, and the result was only too certain.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Brian
MacPhelim
O&#8217;Neill.</div>

<p>Fitzwilliam himself reported that the immediate effect of
the pamphlet had been to strengthen the Scots, whose
alliance all the Northern tribes now sought, and that a
common danger had made O&#8217;Donnell and O&#8217;Neill friends.
The expense of restoring peace was likely to be greater than
any private interest could warrant. Sir Brian MacPhelim
pleaded his own cause with considerable force. He had served
Sussex, Croft, and Sidney faithfully, and had lately borne
the whole cost of victualling Carrickfergus; and the Queen,
ignorant as he believed of his daily usefulness, was now
about to give away his inheritance to Saxons. In her service
he had spent more cows and horses than were in any one
English county, and so it should always be while he was left
in command. Clandeboye had been in the hands of his
family for fourteen generations, and he now begged for a
royal grant in consideration of faithful service from his childhood.
Whatever may have been the Queen&#8217;s actual intention
towards Sir Brian MacPhelim and the other Irish, it is clear
that no good was intended them. Smith covenanted to
suppress all rebels not only in Ards but in Clandeboye, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
divide the lands among the adventurers, and not to sell to
any Irishman or Scot. English settlers were forbidden,
except by royal license, to intermarry with Irish or Scots,
and they were all bound to attend the Deputy anywhere in
Ulster for forty days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vain attempts
to
reassure
Sir Brian.</div>

<p>Fitzwilliam vainly tried to explain away Smith&#8217;s project:
for all answer the unlucky pamphlet was laid before him.
Smith himself would fain have counteracted by a letter the
mischief done by his &#8216;books spread in print.&#8217; He said he
was not coming to rob Sir Phelim, but to help that loyal
chief, and he was willing to have any points in which their
interests might differ decided by a lawful judge rather than
by an appeal to arms. As a beginning of friendship he
begged Sir Brian to be the protector of his people. The
language was not ill chosen, and had it been followed by wise
action, the scheme might yet have succeeded. The Queen
also wrote to Sir Brian, promising, in language which
&#8216;gladded&#8217; him, that his lands should not be taken away. Had
Sir Brian and his friends been frankly invited, as Tremayne
advised, to co-operate with the Queen in a well-designed
scheme for planting some thinly peopled districts within the
Earldom of Ulster, they might perhaps have been friendly,
though even that is very doubtful: managed as it was, the
project was foredoomed to failure.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzwilliam
has
no money.</div>

<p>Fitzwilliam did not cease to beg for his recall or for men
and money to do something worthy of the place which he
was forced to fill. In his office of Vice-Treasurer he had
incurred debt to the Crown, and if only allowed to go back
to England he would sell Milton to pay them. In the meantime
Ireland lay at the mercy of a foreign enemy. Let but
6,000 Spaniards land, and the loss would be as irrevocable
as that of Calais, nor would the Narrow Seas be any longer
safe. Fitzwilliam supposed that Sidney was his enemy at
Court; but the friendly tone of Leicester&#8217;s letters makes this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
unlikely, and it is probable that the real difficulty was with
the Queen. Still the late and present Deputies differed
widely about the respective merits of Butlers and Geraldines.
Ormonde had often begged Elizabeth not to hear his accusers
in his absence; and Sidney may have reported against
him, for he was now sent for. This was too much for Fitzwilliam&#8217;s
endurance. The South, he said, always was tickly,
Ormonde only could manage it, and in short he could not be
spared.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
reduces the
army.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A loyal
Irishman.</div>

<p>Ulster was greatly excited by colonisation rumours,
and multitudinous hordes of Scots, introduced by Tirlogh
Luineach and his wife, or seeking settlement for themselves,
kept the scanty English garrisons in constant alarm. Sorley
Boy MacDonnell with 700 men beset Carrickfergus. Captain
Cheston, a brave and discreet soldier, sallied forth at the
head of his company and discomfited his assailants, but received
an arrow in his thigh; such surgery as was available
failing to extract it, he lingered fourteen days, and then died.
This was the moment chosen by Elizabeth to reduce the
army in Ireland. 9,400<i>l.</i> was sent over with strict injunctions
to discharge 166 men from the foot companies and 70
from the garrisons of Leighlin, Dungarvan, Maryborough,
Bunratty, and Ballintober, and to hold 500 more in readiness
to go as soon as the money arrived. The news spread fast
over Ireland, causing &#8216;general jollity&#8217; and a universal belief
that the days of Saxon rule were over, that an Irish nobleman
would be Viceroy, and that all late English settlers
would soon be hurrying to the seaside. &#8216;When all be discharged,&#8217;
said the unfortunate Deputy, &#8216;God send me some
rid out of Ireland, for I look to see fire round about in every
quarter; but I must confess this medicine is well taken
away, for the disease did but putrefy under it without any
heal.&#8217; Among the men discharged were several who had
been at Derry, and who had received pensions since the
abandonment of the post. One of these, Edmond Byrne,
deserves a passing notice. He had been in the service of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Don Carlos, and on hearing a Spanish gentleman speak evil
of Queen Elizabeth, had attacked him at the palace gates,
though attended by two armed followers. Having killed his
man and beaten off the two underlings, Byrne first took
sanctuary, and then fled to Portugal. There the same conduct
provoked the same retort, and Byrne wounded the
slanderer of his sovereign. This loyal Irishman afterwards
received a pension of four shillings a day.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Poverty of
the Crown.</div>

<p>The best excuse for Elizabeth&#8217;s ill-judged parsimony was
the great difficulty which she found in getting money at this
time. The breach with Alva had destroyed the credit system
of the Netherlands, and English finance had not yet become
sufficient to itself. Moreover, the Queen took care that Spain
should be fully occupied, and the capture of Brill, which
coincided with the discharge of the troops in Ireland, made a
Spanish descent on that country exceedingly improbable.
Alva had never been able to replace the Genoese treasure
detained in England, and it was pretty clear that there would
be none to spare for less important services. But by the relaxation
of English efforts in Ireland, nearly all that had been
done there was neutralised, and it is impossible not to feel
some pity for Fitzwilliam.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitton in
Connaught.</div>

<p>The Presidency of Connaught did not flourish greatly
under Fitton&#8217;s charge; perhaps no one could have done anything
there without a considerable army. He could indict
O&#8217;Connor Don and MacDermot for high treason, he could
lay whole baronies waste, and he could generally take castles.
But he could not establish either peace or respect for the
common law, and he dared not, while he remained in the
province, leave the Brehon law in undisputed possession of
the field. The civil and the canon law, as well as the law of
England, all declared that a man should be held liable only
for his own acts. But Irish custom extended the liability to
descendants and to collaterals, and Fitton seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
thought it possible to play fast and loose with the two systems,
and to use their own customs against the Irish, though contrary,
as he believed, to all law, human and divine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clanricarde&#8217;s
sons.</div>

<p>The Earl of Clanricarde&#8217;s two sons were in open rebellion,
and he was bound to answer for them both by Irish law, of
which he had accepted the liabilities, and by agreement
under his own hand. The Earl was loyal enough, as his
whole career showed, but he was unable to control his clan,
and was perhaps not sorry to get out of a temporary difficulty
by surrendering himself. There were frequent and very circumstantial
reports of an intended Spanish descent, and he
may well have dreaded the necessity either of joining or of
opposing an invader who was under papal patronage. Fitton
seems to have had no other case against the old lord than
that he levied exactions like his ancestors, a charge which
came with remarkably bad grace from the President. Fitzwilliam
said openly that he could only be chastised by bringing
in the Mayo Burkes, who had always been rebels, and he
very justifiably shrank from such a miserable expedient. A
more respectable plan was to send Thomond home and encourage
him to earn a complete restoration by his service
against the Clanricarde rebels.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitton and
Clanricarde.</div>

<p>On first arriving in Dublin, Clanricarde had been shut up
in the castle. After a month he was released on his own recognisances,
and three months later he was again committed
on Fitton preferring against him a formal charge of being the
counsellor, comforter, and procurer of his son&#8217;s doings. A few
months before Fitzwilliam had pronounced Fitton a wise and
sober man, very conscientious, severely just, and not subject
to gusts of passion. He now complained that the President
had refused to reveal the charge against Clanricarde at the
Council Board. This the Lord Deputy considered a stain on
his own loyalty, and he demanded an opportunity of clearing
himself. The Earl&#8217;s offence, if offence there was, fell far short
of treason, and he could be very badly spared from his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
country. The Queen rebuked Fitton severely for his secret
ways, and for arresting the old Earl, who made his submission
to the Lord President of Connaught, only asking that he
might in future have the assistance of a councillor to keep
order. This was granted, and he was soon sent back to Connaught
with a general commission to grant pardons at discretion;
a wonderful end to a trial for high treason. The
Council patched up a truce between Fitton and Fitzwilliam,
but the flame soon burst forth again. Clanricarde&#8217;s detention
in Dublin lasted about six months, and he never quite forgave
Fitton. &#8216;After being set at liberty,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I did within
one twelvemonth hang my own son, my brother&#8217;s son, my
cousin-german&#8217;s son, and one of the captains of my gallowglasses,
besides fifty of my own followers that bare armour
and weapons; which the Archbishop of Tuam, the Bishop of
Clonfert, and the whole corporation of Galway may witness.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>When Fitton wrote to say that he expected soon to have
no place in his power except Galway, Fitzwilliam sneeringly
answered that he would be a very old man before the rebels
came to seek him at Athlone. For a few weeks longer the
President kept the field. Clare Galway was yielded at his
approach, and a few kerne were shot here and there, but the
young Burkes eluded him as completely as David eluded
Saul. On one occasion they were close, and Ulick, taking
an axe in his hand, declared that he would lead on; but the
captain of gallowglasses, wiser in his generation, advised
a fitter opportunity. Lady Mary Burke escaped out of Galway,
and went to join her brothers. Then provisions ran
short, the Mayo Burkes, whom Fitzwilliam had thought it
possible to retain as allies, joined their namesake, and Fitton

<p>Fitton was only three months older when he saw his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
dismal prophecy fulfilled. Having demolished most of the
castles in Clanricarde, lest they should offer a refuge to
the English, the young Burkes, with a force estimated at
from 500 to 2,000, and largely composed of Scots mercenaries,
plundered the district between the Suck and Shannon, then
crossed the great river, and burned all along the left bank as
far as Athlone. James Fitzmaurice was with them, chiefly
in the vain hope of relieving Castlemaine, before which Perrott
had again sat down. Turning to the east, the wild bands
harried Roscommon and Westmeath, burned Mullingar, Meelick,
and other places, and then doubled back to Athlone,
to which they set fire. In spite of the guns in the castle and
the musketeers on the steeple of the church, they approached
boldly from the north side, broke into the cloister with the
help of masons, and, being aided by a high wind, burned
most of the malt and biscuit stored above. Of the 350
soldiers promised by Fitzwilliam not one had arrived, and
the President could only look on while the town burned.
Meeting with no resistance, the rebels again crossed the
Shannon and went to Galway. That town was too strong
for them to attempt, but they killed an English captain in
a skirmish, and on two separate occasions passed the walls
without serious opposition and penetrated into Connemara,
where they chastised the O&#8217;Flaherties for their adherence to
English rule. Fitton could do nothing but beg the Lord
Deputy not to pardon the treason after the old fashion of
Ireland. &#8216;It is comforted,&#8217; he said, &#8216;and fostered from under
your own elbows, I mean Dublin itself.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitton is
forced to
leave Connaught
to itself.</div>

<p>Fitton lingered at Athlone for a few weeks and then
retired, first to Dublin and then to England. Fitzwilliam
announced that Connaught would soon be quiet, for there
would be no one left to resist the rebels. The unlucky
President was not to be blamed, for he &#8216;could not work
miracles as Moses did.&#8217; After one more attempt to give
trouble, which was frustrated by Perrott&#8217;s energy, Clanri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>carde&#8217;s
sons&mdash;the MacIarlas, as they were called&mdash;saw that
there was no fear of punishment, and that they might as well
sue for mercy. They told the Deputy that they were in
a wretched and damnable state; and this was true, for they
were very vicious young men. They knew not where to
turn, and they offered to give themselves up and be good
subjects for ever if only they might be assured of the pardon
which they feared to ask. Their father was powerless to
control them, and he supported their petition on the ground
that despair might &#8216;make them follow young counsels.&#8217; He
himself was ready for any service, or even to go to prison,
and would welcome any president that had no property
in Connaught, &#8216;excepting always Sir Edward Fitton, who
sought my blood.&#8217; A good salary, he added fairly enough,
would be the best defence against corruption. Believing
that Fitton would traduce him, he sent an agent to England
to enter a cross case. The late president&#8217;s prayer was so far
heard that the young Burkes received no immediate pardon.
In the meantime Athlone was held by a scanty garrison. In
one of the long nights just after the new year Art Maguire,
who had the watch, arranged with some of the O&#8217;Kellys to
betray the castle. A ladder was planted and thirty-four men
scaled the walls unobserved, when a chance noise startled the
guard. The assailants called out in English to make way for
the Earl of Clanricarde&#8217;s sons; but they were worsted in the
scuffle and jumped off the battlements, several legs being
broken. &#8216;If the devils had not made great shifts they had
broken most of their necks.&#8217; Fitzwilliam attributed the
result entirely to God&#8217;s providence. The Irish had been two
hours inside the castle and were probably waiting for reinforcements,
very likely for the graceless young men in whose
names they professed to act.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ormonde
goes to
England.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzmaurice
still at
large,
1572.</div>

<p>Ormonde was summoned to England at the beginning of
1572, and there were not wanting detractors to say that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
was unwilling to go, and that he was playing a game of his
own. Some thought him too merciful, and one of his followers
asked Burghley to give him a private hint inculcating
severity. But neither Perrott nor Fitzwilliam could do without
him, and he was certainly not idle. The pursuit of Fitzmaurice
was but a wild-goose chase, and every now and then
some new Geraldine partisan arose and gave local trouble.
Edward Butler, with five hundred men, went to Aherlow,
killed a few kerne, and drove off some cattle which had been
stolen from Kerry; but he never saw Fitzmaurice, though he
reported that he was weak and might be easily attacked.
The difficulty was to find him. Meanwhile Rory MacShane,
with a small band, swept away what he could find in the
meadows about Clonmel. The townsmen were disinclined
to follow, but their sovereign threatened to denounce them
as traitors, and they accompanied him into the hills near the
town. The foolhardy sovereign, who had refused Ormonde&#8217;s
offer of a garrison, allowed himself to be drawn into rough
ground, and lost his life. Then came Edward Butler, who
killed twenty-one of Rory&#8217;s men. The solitary prisoner was
promptly hanged, drawn, and quartered. Besides these
services performed through his brother, Ormonde was able
at this time to make head against Rory Oge O&#8217;More, while
Kildare, with six hundred kerne of his own and a hundred
of the Queen&#8217;s, pressed that chief from the North.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lord
President
reports
progress.</div>

<p>At another time Fitzmaurice threatened Youghal, but
the Viscount of Decies sent timely aid. If to keep the
Queen&#8217;s peace was the object of government, it had very
indifferent success. Yet Perrott did not despair. Wales
and Northumbria had been settled by Presidents, and why
not Munster? &#8216;Came it to perfection elsewhere in one year?
No, not in seven.&#8217; The Irish were subtle, fond of license,
and ready for anything as long as it was not for their good.
But he claimed to have laid a sound foundation. Munster
was no longer governed by letters from Dublin which no one
obeyed. Before he came no man could go a mile outside
Cork, Limerick, Youghal, Kinsale, Kilmallock, Dingle, or
Cashel. No one helped but Ormonde, yet the country had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
become fairly safe, and English fishermen fished in peace.
The rebels had dwindled from 1,000 to &#8216;fifty poor kerne, and
ten or twelve bad horsemen.&#8217; The decentralising system
might be carried much further, and Perrott recommended a
President for Ulster. The Lord Deputy might then spend
some part of his time at Athlone. The advice was probably
good, but the poverty of the Crown hindered all comprehensive
reforms.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Castlemaine
taken.
Perrott
cannot
catch Fitzmaurice.</div>

<p>Early in June Perrott again besieged Castlemaine. Most
of the MacCarthies, O&#8217;Sullivans, and other West Munster
clans furnished contingents, as well as the Barrys and Roches,
and some of the walled towns. James Fitzmaurice having
failed to bring the Scots from Connaught to its relief, the
castle surrendered after a three months&#8217; blockade, &#8216;through
the want of provisions,&#8217; say the annalists, &#8216;not at all for want
of defence.&#8217; This being the only place which resisted the
English arms, and the most convenient spot for foreigners to
land, the success was a considerable one in spite of the time
it had taken. When it was just too late Fitzmaurice, with
Ulick Burke and Shane MacOliver, passed the Shannon near
Portumna, with the help of the O&#8217;Maddens, and marched
down the left bank towards Limerick, the fears or sympathies
of the citizens again swelling their numbers to 1,000. The
sheriff attempting to withstand them was slain with thirty of
his men, and Perrott, who besides his own servants had only
160 English soldiers, at once proceeded in search of them.
He was accompanied by several native lords and chiefs, but
seems to have set but little store by their services. Fitzmaurice
lurked in the wooded and boggy plain between
Limerick and Pallas, and MacBrien Coonagh sent word to
Perrott that the Scots would certainly fight in the neighbourhood
of Ballinagarde. The floods were out, and the
President found his enemy, apparently about 600 strong,
advantageously posted on ground inaccessible to cavalry, and
unapproachable even by foot soldiers marching more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
two abreast. Perrott threw forward a few musketeers to
skirmish, and then quitting the saddle led the way on foot to
encourage the Irish lords, the attack being covered by a body
of musketeers. The Scots threw their spears at the skirmishers
and seemed disposed to charge, but a second and
better-directed volley broke them, and they fled in disorder
towards the Glen of Aherlow, leaving a few dead on the field.
Perrott followed through a frightful country, but could not
get a second chance. Clancare and Cormac MacTeige,
MacCarthies who in their soul hated the Desmonds, did
good service, but the other allies were lukewarm. Perrott
blamed Lord Roche for keeping aloof with the cavalry, but if
the President&#8217;s own description of the ground be true, his
lordship had little choice. Ormonde was in England, and
his presence alone would have done as much as all his forces
without him; but Sir Edmund Butler co-operated zealously
enough with the President, and the penitent Edward exhorted
him to fresh exertions. &#8216;Remember,&#8217; he said, &#8216;my dear
brother, that though you did never so much service, it is but
your duty, and far less than her Majesty deserved at our hands.&#8217;
On one occasion the Butlers brought in fifty heads, and Perrott
allowed that they served most willingly in the field, though he
does not seem to have had a high opinion of their actual
achievements.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Perrott
cannot pay
his soldiers.
A mutiny.</div>

<p>There were rumours of a second invasion of Scots from
Connaught, but they did not come, and Perrott was left free to
follow those already in his province. The indefatigable man
made such preparations as he could for a grand attack on
Aherlow with the help of the two Butlers, and he set out
from Kilmallock in advance of his army. When he had
gone a few miles the captains overtook him in hot haste to
say that their men had mutinied and had returned to Kilmallock.
The Irish auxiliaries were not bound to serve
without English soldiers, and they immediately deserted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
President, glad enough, no doubt, of the excuse. A few of
the gentlemen remained, and Perrott retraced his steps to
find his soldiers still under arms, clamouring for the Queen&#8217;s
pay, and complaining of the endless and thankless toil to
which they were condemned. He reminded them that he
had already offered some money on account, that more was
on the way, that they had but slender excuse for their insubordination,
and that he had a mind to hang the ringleaders.
The men answered firmly but respectfully that if
he hanged one they would all swing together for company,
and in the end he was forced to temporise. Crippled as a
general, the President went off to hold assizes at Cork, where
he found the people willing to prosecute and the juries ready
to convict, so that the pleasures of hanging were not altogether
denied him. The garrison of Kilmallock, in a fit of
repentance, or persuaded by their officers, made a raid into
Aherlow and killed some thirty of Fitzmaurice&#8217;s men sleeping
in their cabins. &#8216;I am ashamed to write of so few,&#8217; said the
Lord President, &#8216;but considering their cowardliness and the
continual watch which they use to keep, it is accounted as
much here to have the lives of so few, as 1,000 in some other
country. If I might have but one trusty gentleman of the
Irishry I would not doubt I should in short time bring
the country to good quiet.&#8217; That one trusty gentleman was
not to be had, but Ormonde&#8217;s brothers did what they could
to prove that they were not, and, in spite of recent transgressions,
never had been Irishry. Without any help from
Perrott they attacked Fitzmaurice in his camp near Tipperary,
and killed 100 of his men. That was the last important
success of the campaign, which had proved beyond doubt that
the rebels had no chance in the field against English soldiers
or even against the Butler gallowglasses; but it had also
proved that they could not be followed with advantage, and
that the problem of Irish government was as far from solution
as ever.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Stratagems
of Fitzmaurice.</div>

<p>On one occasion (we are not told the date or place) the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
hunter nearly became a prey to his quarry. A pretended
deserter brought news that Fitzmaurice was hard by with
only thirty persons, and offered to be the President&#8217;s guide,
tendering his own life as security. With characteristic rashness
Perrott followed the man with about thirty soldiers, and
at the break of day came upon Fitzmaurice accompanied by
400 or 500 foot and 80 horse. Trewbrigg, the President&#8217;s
secretary, who rode in advance, charged the Irish and Scots
with three or four men, and lost his own life and a purse
containing 100<i>l.</i>, which served as a military chest. Nothing
daunted, Perrott followed with the rest of his men. He
jumped a bank and unhorsed one of the rebels. Another
came behind him with his spear, held by the middle as in
an Indian boar-hunt, and he was barely rescued by George
Greame, afterwards famous in the Irish wars. Outnumbered
by ten or twelve to one, the English soldiers were nearly overwhelmed,
when Captain Bowles, not much more prudent than
his chief, galloped up with three or four fresh men. Supposing
these to be the advanced guard of a larger body, Fitzmaurice
drew off. Even this lesson did not teach Perrott prudence.
Fitzmaurice, being closely pursued, faced about near a bridge
leading to a wood, and sent a man with a white cloth on the
top of his spear. The Lord President allowed himself to be
drawn into a parley, and while he wrangled about terms
Fitzmaurice got his men over the water and escaped.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish
in Spain.
Stukeley.</div>

<p>The incessant rumours of Spanish invasion led to nothing,
but these foreign intrigues are worth following for the light
which they throw upon Elizabeth&#8217;s policy. Stukeley, finding
that the Archbishop of Cashel&#8217;s party would not accept him
as the champion of Irish Catholicism, went to Rome, where
he walked barelegged and barefooted about the churches and
streets. Fitzwilliam derisively reported that the man who
had given up the kingdom of Florida and the dukedom of
Ireland only for holiness&#8217; sake was about to have a red hat,
and that the superstitious people of Waterford really believed
in his sanctity. Constant communication was kept up between
Ireland, Spain, and the Low Countries, and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
scarcely a southern chief or lord who was not supposed to be
in correspondence with Stukeley or with some other of the
exiles. Many probably sympathised with the idea of a
Spanish invasion, though not to such an extent as the sanguine
Fitzgibbon had represented, and others may have
thought it prudent to make friends with the mammon of
unrighteousness. The adventurer, after his return from
Rome, was attracted by the somewhat kindred spirit of Don
John of Austria, and served under him either at Lepanto or
in some smaller encounter with the Turks, after which he
retired to Madrid, and &#8216;for his many deeds&#8217; became more of
a favourite than ever. A pension of 1,000 ducats per week
was thought a suitable entertainment for the Duke of Ireland,
and one Cahir O&#8217;Rourke obtained the command of forty
men. The Bishop of Cadiz received orders from Philip to
punish those who refused passages to the Irish refugees,
friars, and others, and one Cormac, calling himself provincial
of the Irish Dominicans, busied himself in seeing that the
order was carried out. The French captains under one pretence
or other refused to carry these emissaries; but the
Portuguese were more subservient, and many Irishmen sailed
from Lisbon as well as from the Spanish ports. Meanwhile
loyal Englishmen were subjected to every inconvenience.
Five ships were stopped at San Lucar and three at Seville,
and many of Elizabeth&#8217;s subjects were closely imprisoned.
The Inquisition worked harder than ever. Rumours of a
fleet to be commanded by Stukeley were again rife, and some
talked of as many as fifty ships. Philip II.&#8217;s slow mind was
quite unequal to the task of coping with such statesmen as
Cecil and Walsingham, and they were able to watch every
move. English merchants and sea-captains, even Compostella
pilgrims, took a pride in thwarting the despot, who seldom
travelled further than Aranjuez, and imagined that he could
rule all mankind by making silly marginal notes on despatches.
Waterford having been recommended in 1569 as the best
point for attacking Ireland, Philip, who apparently heard of
the place for the first time, could only wonder in manuscript
&#8216;whether the Duke of Feria knew anything of that port.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>&#8217;
Considering that Philip had been King of England, this is a
fine illustration of the aphorism as to the small amount of
wisdom with which the world is governed.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
St. Bartholomew in
Ireland.</div>

<p>The day of St. Bartholomew could not but have its effect
in Ireland. In Connaught and other Irish districts &#8216;the
godly,&#8217; as the few Protestants esteemed themselves, thought
it prudent to hide. The rest of the people triumphed &#8216;as
though the kingdom of Antichrist were once again erected.&#8217;
There was talk of the Spanish Inquisition, but little or no
actual violence is recorded to have been done. Suspicion
filled the air, and the sudden appearance of innumerable
friars seemed to bode some great foreign movement. They
came out of Ulster and traversed Connaught in companies of
twenty at a time. Cormac, the so-called Provincial of the
Dominicans, brought a budget of indulgences to Sligo, and
published them openly. Friars preached at Galway before
the ex-mayor and other leading townsmen, and held councils
at Adare, Galway, and Donegal. They came and
went between Ireland and France, and Fitzwilliam&#8217;s informant
held that the preaching of Ulster friars &#8216;must
naturally tend to rebellion.&#8217; Their evident desire, he
thought, was to subvert the English Government, and &#8216;set
up their own wickedness.&#8217; In Galway the mendicants bore
themselves like princes, so that the Pope might be thought
King of England and Ireland. Clanricarde himself dared
not say a word, and Limerick threatened to be soon as bad as
Galway.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rise of
Rory Oge
O&#8217;More.</div>

<p>Those parts of Ireland which were supposed to be tolerably
well settled were pervaded by a sense of insecurity, and gave
Fitzwilliam no help. King&#8217;s County, under the wise government
of Henry Cowley, noted by an eminent lawyer as being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the only Englishman who ruled by law, was long an exception;
but the Queen owed the constable near 2,000<i>l.</i>, and
such disinterestedness could not be expected from every
officer. Cowley had but twenty-three men, and, though
others praised him, he was himself dissatisfied with the state
of his district. Cosby was less successful in the Queen&#8217;s
County, where Rory Oge O&#8217;More still kept an armed remnant
of his tribe together. Kildare and Ormonde combined their
forces but could not catch him, and he refused to cross the
Barrow except in the company of the former Earl, who
accordingly brought him to his castle of Kilkea. Rory said
he would make no war against the Queen, but must be
assured of life and living before he would submit; nor would
he disperse his men, who were his only protection against
many enemies. After consulting with Cosby, the two Earls
gave him protection for a fortnight, on his undertaking not
to damage the corn. When Ormonde went to England Rory
broke out again, and found his neighbours willing enough to
help him. Bands of fifty or a hundred invaded the Pale
nightly with music and torches, as Fitzwilliam bitterly observed,
&#8216;lest they should be heard or seen,&#8217; yet he would not
blame Cosby, for he had neither men nor money.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
O&#8217;Byrnes.</div>

<p>In Wexford a gentleman named Browne was murdered
by the O&#8217;Byrnes, among whom Feagh MacHugh was rising
into distinction as a guerilla chief. Agard, the seneschal of
Wicklow, took immediate vengeance on some of the mountaineers,
and was then inclined to hold out hopes of mercy as
the best chance of catching the most guilty parties, such
as Matthew Furlong and others, who had employed the
O&#8217;Byrnes. But Nicholas White, the seneschal of Wexford,
went &#8216;thundering&#8217; about saying that the Queen would never
pardon anyone who had a hand in Browne&#8217;s murder. Fitzwilliam
wished devoutly that White had stayed in England.
The revenge already taken might have been severe enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
even for White&#8217;s taste. Led by a mountaineer whom he had
captured, and whose life was the price of his service as guide,
Agard entered the south-west corner of Wicklow, where he
burned sixteen villages, then passed through the valley of
Imail, where he killed a foster-brother of James Eustace,
afterwards the famous rebel Lord Baltinglass. A sister of
Simon MacDavid&#8217;s was captured, &#8216;whom, if she do not stand
me in stead, I mean to execute.&#8217; Had plunder been the
main object a very large number of cattle might easily have
been driven off, but the guide, who may have had a quarrel
of his own to avenge, offered to take the soldiers where they
might &#8216;have some killing.&#8217; Captain Hungerford and
Lieutenant Parker preferred killing to kine, and went in at
the head of Glendalough. &#8216;They slew many churls, women,
and children,&#8217; brought away much kine, and lost 500 more
&#8216;while they were killing.&#8217; Feagh MacHugh just escaped,
but two of his sisters and two foster-brothers were slain.
Much blood was destined to be shed before the blood of
Robert Browne should be finally expiated. Sometimes the
English officers seem to have set a very indifferent example.
Robert Hartpole, sheriff of Carlow and constable of the Castle,
and his sub-sheriff were accused upon oath of having seized
a vast number of cattle on all sorts of pretences, of forcing
labourers to work, and in general of every sort of violence
and corruption. These misdeeds were said to have been
committed by virtue of letters from the Earl of Ormonde.
In the following year, Hartpole was one of those licensed by
the Lord Deputy to cess Ormonde&#8217;s lands for protection
against the O&#8217;Mores and O&#8217;Connors. No particular notice
seems to have been taken of the charges against him, for he
remained in Carlow to found a family, and to be remembered
as a chief actor in one of the most horrible tragedies recorded
even in Irish history.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bad effects
of reducing
the army.</div>

<p>Fitzwilliam had reduced the army much against his will,
and the disturbances which he had foreseen followed as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
matter of course. He asked for reinforcements, unless the
Queen wished deliberately to leave the whole country to the
native Irish. Her answer was that she marvelled at the
stir in Ireland, and that she would not send the 800 soldiers
he asked for; and she reminded him that Mr. Smith
had been ready to bring over that number if Fitzwilliam had
not opposed the enterprise. Smith was, however, now really
coming, and might give some help. The poor Deputy could
only answer that the 800 men were much wanting, that
double that number of Scots had landed in Connaught, and
that Ormonde, on whom alone he could depend, had been
sent for to England. But to Burghley he passionately poured
out his griefs. &#8216;I pass over,&#8217; he said, &#8216;usual matters, such as
killing, burning, spoiling;&#8217; though they pricked his conscience
daily, and though he feared that God would demand the
innocent blood at his hand. The English name was hateful,
and he would rather die when Ireland was lost than live in
England to bemoan it. He could but shake the scabbard,

<div class="sidenote">The Ulster
colonisation
project.</div>

<p>The absence of Sir Thomas Smith in France and the lukewarm
attitude of the Lord Deputy delayed the Northern
enterprise for some time, and when young Smith at last
landed, the 800 of which the Queen spoke had dwindled
to 100. He sailed from Liverpool on Friday, the sailors&#8217;
unlucky day, and reached Lough Strangford on the morrow.
He sent to Sir Brian MacPhelim to say that he had no
designs except on the spiritual lands&mdash;no designs &#8216;as yet&#8217;
he explained in writing to Burghley&mdash;but the chief would not
see him, and roundly refused to part with one foot of ground.
The adventurer hastened to the Lord Deputy, not to offer
aid but to beg for it; but Fitzwilliam, who had not been consulted,
gave him little comfort, telling the Queen that a
singular ignorance had been shown of the jealous Irish nature,
and that the chance of success had been immeasurably lessened
by sounding the trumpet so loudly beforehand. Others besides
Smith talked loosely of all they were going to do in Ulster;
one Chatterton boasting that he had a grant of O&#8217;Hanlon&#8217;s
country. Fitzwilliam bade him hold his foolish tongue; but
he only talked the louder, and sent his brother to Newry to
spread the mischief further, and to have eight or nine bullocks
ostentatiously salted. &#8216;To have rumours spread,&#8217; said the
Deputy bitterly, &#8216;and a few beeves salted to mad men with,
and to have no men come to tame madmen with, I must
think, or at least doubt, to be some practice to disturb quiet
government.&#8217; Tirlogh Luineach O&#8217;Neill wrote in a covertly
threatening tone to Fitzwilliam, professing not to believe that
Smith had really her Majesty&#8217;s authority to take his namesake&#8217;s
country, and advising him to let Sir Brian and Sorley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Boy alone. Sir Brian emphasised this advice by invading
the Ards, killing Henry Savage, burning the villages, and
driving off all the cattle except what could be hurriedly conveyed
across the Lough into Lecale. Fitzwilliam could only
tell Sir Thomas Smith that he was sorry for his son&#8217;s evil
prospects, but that soldiers were very scarce, and that, though
his goodwill was great, in material resources he &#8216;had not
enough to set out the main chance.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Collapse of
Smith&#8217;s enterprise.</div>

<p>Sir Thomas Smith perhaps hardly expected to get nothing
but criticisms from the Lord Deputy. The reports
complained of had been spread against his will, and he had
no intention towards the Irish but to make them labour virtuously,
&#8216;and to leave robbing and stealing and killing one
another.&#8217; He suggested that, as his son could evidently effect
nothing for the present, Fitzwilliam should employ him in the
Queen&#8217;s pay to defend the northern frontier of the Pale. As
Fitzwilliam could not pay even the few men he had, this was
hardly a practical suggestion. The O&#8217;Neills played fast and
loose with the unfortunate young man. Sometimes a minor
chief would make friendly advances, and then, having seen
the nakedness of the land, would run off again, while Tirlogh
Luineach and Sir Brian MacPhelim evidently understood
each other. It was only just possible to defend Carrickfergus
with the help of Captain Maltby, whose company had
narrowly escaped discharge, and who generally lay in Lecale.
From behind the walls of the fortress Smith railed continually
at the Lord Deputy, whose gloomy vaticinations had all been
fulfilled. In writing to the Queen and to Smith&#8217;s father, Fitzwilliam
merely lamented that his power to help him was not
equal to his will, but he told Burghley that he thought it
very hard that his credit at Court should be undermined by
the interest of a vain young man. Maintenance and not
stomach was what the adventurer required, and he wished
Burghley could see the letters he wrote to the Council. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
impudent humour needed rather to be purged than fed.
Maltby, a man of ability and discretion, fell to some extent
under the influence of his sanguine comrade, and the two
persuaded Fitzwilliam to give them command of the garrison
at Newry, by way of operating against Sir Brian
MacPhelim. They prophesied great things, but did nothing;
and Fitzwilliam, who had yielded to their importunity for
fear of Court slanders, cynically observed that he never supposed
they would do anything. Sir Brian, on the contrary,
burned Carrickfergus, and 100 men had to be sent in haste
from Newry to protect the pier, the store-house, and what
little remained of the town. The enterprise of the Smiths,
from which so much had been expected and which had been
so much advertised, had utterly collapsed in less than a
year.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzmaurice
submits.
Perrott
thinks he
will be a
second St.
Paul.</div>

<p>After his last overthrow by Sir Edmund Butler, Fitzmaurice
no longer attempted to make head, but sued for
pardon and leave to serve her Majesty in some other country,
offering at the same time to disclose the chief instigators of
his revolt. He had still eighty kerne with him, and found
no difficulty in feeding his men either in Aherlow or in the
wild district between Macroom and Glengariffe. Perrott,
who wished to hunt out rather than pardon him, watched the
ports so carefully as to frustrate many attempts at evasion.
At least one important emissary fell into the Lord President&#8217;s
hands in the person of Edmond O&#8217;Donnell, a Jesuit, who
brought letters from Gregory XIII. to Fitzmaurice, and who
was afterwards hanged, drawn, and quartered at Cork. The
pursuit of the arch-rebel himself failed for want of provisions.
The President was very much against the established system
of governing &#8216;by intreaty,&#8217; and his object was to make people
fear him, &#8216;so that they be not kept in servile fear.&#8217; The
Queen sent letters of thanks to Lords Clancare, Barrymore,
Fermoy, and Lixnaw, to Sir Thomas of Desmond, and to Sir
Donough and Sir Cormac MacTeige MacCarthy; and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
end, fearing lest he should escape to Spain, Perrott thought
it desirable to accept the submission of Fitzmaurice. He
appeared accordingly at Kilmallock, the town which had suffered
so much and so lately at his hands, accompanied by the
seneschal of Imokilly and other chief rebels. The suppliants
knelt on both knees, or, according to one account, even lay
prostrate, and the President held the point of his naked
sword at Fitzmaurice&#8217;s breast. &#8216;Holding their hands joined
and cast upwards, and with countenances bewraying their
great sorrow and fervent repentance for their former life,&#8217;
they confessed their sins in Irish. Fitzmaurice repeated the
confession in English, owning himself the rankest traitor
alive, and vowing to use his sword for ever after only in her
Majesty&#8217;s service. As if to throw a shade of ridicule upon
the whole thing, Fitzmaurice absurdly declared that he was
allured by Clancare and Sir Edmund Butler. But Perrott
was forced to be content, and had similar ceremonies performed
in other towns, the inferior traitors wearing halters
round their necks. Fitzmaurice gave up one of his sons
as a hostage, but it was arranged that he himself should be
set at liberty in case the Queen refused to accept his submission.
She was glad to find an excuse for saving money
in Munster, or anywhere else; and Perrott, with the strange
inconsistency he sometimes showed, soon persuaded himself
that Fitzmaurice had really seen the error of his ways, and
would prove &#8216;a second St. Paul.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond

<p>The Presidency had proved expensive, but Perrott could
report that no armed bands were abroad, and that every
corner of the province was safe for unarmed travellers.
Gilbert had done nearly as much before, but it was clear that
no permanent good could be done without sustained expenditure.
The experiment of ruling the Southern Geraldines
without the Earl of Desmond was accordingly abandoned for
the time; and, in spite of the warnings of Perrott and Fitzwilliam,
Elizabeth may really have thought that years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
exile had tamed the Earl&#8217;s unruly spirit. He had indeed
endured many humiliations. Arriving in London with his
brother Sir John, about Christmas 1567, he was allowed to
frequent the Court, in great want of money, but under no
personal restraint. The brothers made humble submissions,
surrendering their lands to the Queen and begging for the
establishment of a President and Council in Munster; and the
Earl gave a bond in 20,000<i>l.</i> to observe the articles to which
he was bound. But his rash talk, and perhaps the letters
which he was known to write, gave offence, and both he and
Sir John were sent close prisoners to the Tower, where they
were fain to beg 100<i>l.</i> for necessaries, including clothes and
shoes. They suffered from cold, and Sir John, who became
seriously ill, had not wherewithal to pay the doctor and
apothecary: anything that they did cost was paid for by the
Queen, nothing whatever being remitted from the Irish
estates.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Desmonds

till 1573.</div>

<p>Lady Desmond wrote to say Fitzmaurice had so wasted
the country that she could not get as much as would pay her
travelling charges. &#8216;I pray God,&#8217; she concluded, &#8216;send us
joyful meeting or me short departure out of this world. If
you make any provision for me, I beseech you let the same
be in readiness in Bristol against my coming, and upon
information thereof I will in all haste repair towards you.
Your loving, miserable wife,</p>

<p class="sigline">&#8216;<span class="smcap">Eleanor Desmond</span>.&#8217;</p>

<p>Soon after this she joined her husband, and remained
with him during the rest of his two years&#8217; confinement in the
Tower. After that they were all handed over to the keeping
of Sir Warham St. Leger, who hated Ormonde, and might
therefore be supposed a kind gaoler to his enemy. Sir
Warham complained bitterly of the expense and trouble to
which he was put; for, besides the Earl and Countess and Sir
John, there were thirteen or fourteen servants, and they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
not the price of a pair of shoes between them. Shut up in
St. Leger&#8217;s small house in Southwark, they all suffered in
health and ran up a long bill for medicine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Birth of
Desmond&#8217;s
son.</div>

<p>It was about this time that Lady Desmond gave birth to
the unfortunate child whose dismal fate it was to know himself
the last and weakest of his race, and to die young without
ever having known youth. Sir Warham grew heartily tired
of his guests, his kindness to whom brought suspicion on
himself. He even asked to be imprisoned to save him from
further danger. The restraints of the Desmonds were gradually
relaxed, though St. Leger remained their custodian,
and by the beginning of 1572 there was already much talk
of sending them back to Ireland, Perrott being willing
enough to receive Sir John, but preferring that the Earl and
Countess should have a year of the Tower, since they had
been using their liberty to write letters encouraging Fitzmaurice
to persevere in his rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
tries to
escape.
Martin
Frobisher.</div>

<p>That Desmond should try to escape from England was
but natural, and his choosing the time of the Paris massacre
for an attempt probably shows that some deeper plotters than
he were trying to make him a pawn in their game. There
were many Irishmen about London, some of whom were
known and others suspected as the bringers of treasonable
letters, and Burghley had his counterplot ready. The famous
sea-captain Martin Frobisher, as loyal a subject as any Queen
Elizabeth had, was probably directed to put himself in the
Earl&#8217;s way. Ormonde, who came to London about this time,
dined with Desmond and said he would try to get him
despatched for Ireland; and it may be conjectured, though
not very charitably, that this was meant to lull him into
a false security. Desmond was afraid to see Frobisher, who,
however, contrived to let him know that he was willing to
be bought, and that a ship of 100 tons and the island of
Valentia might be a suitable price. Desmond was a bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
horseman, unable indeed to mount without help, probably
through the wound received at Affane, and was, moreover,
afraid to ride into Kent lest he should meet Sir Warham&#8217;s
men. He preferred an oyster boat which would pass the
Queen&#8217;s ships at Gravesend without being searched, and
Frobisher promised to help him to such a craft. So well was
the farce acted that one of Burghley&#8217;s spies took credit for
discovering the plot months after Frobisher had disclosed
all; the captain&#8217;s wife having been employed to lay a false
scent and to implicate not only her husband but St. Leger,
Jerome Brett, and others who were supposed to be seeking
revenge for their failure in obtaining a grant of the Desmond
territories in Munster. 20<i>l.</i> in money or land was to
be Frobisher&#8217;s own reward for taking the whole party over
to Stukeley and for invading Ireland from Spain. Mrs.
Frobisher, if she had any sense of humour, must have been
amused at the great secrecy enjoined upon her by the spy
whom she was hoodwinking. It is not unlikely that Burghley
or some underling of his was trying to get evidence of
treasonable designs, but if so the plan was changed, and,
instead of sending Desmond to the Tower or to Tower Hill,
it was resolved to let him go back to Ireland. He begged
that Ormonde might be sent with him, ostensibly because his
arrival in Munster would be certain to drive the rebels out of
his own country into Tipperary; really, perhaps, because he
was afraid to leave the field clear for his rival at Court.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
restored.</div>

<p>After much writing and talking the terms of Desmond&#8217;s
return were at last settled. He accepted the Anglican religious
establishment in the fullest manner, renouncing
foreign jurisdictions and promising to assist all bishops,
ministers, and preachers. He undertook to keep the Queen&#8217;s
peace generally, and in particular not to molest Lords Fitzmaurice
of Kerry, Barrymore, Courcy, and Decies, or any of
the MacCarthies, O&#8217;Sullivans, and O&#8217;Callaghans; and all dues
properly chargeable to them were to be levied only by legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
process. The Earl bound himself to put down Fitzmaurice&#8217;s
rebellion as soon as possible, to apprehend those who had
fled to foreign countries, and to leave such castles in the
Queen&#8217;s hands as she might think necessary for the public
interest. In general he was to hold the same position as
Kildare or Ormonde, and he agreed not to exercise the
palatinate jurisdiction which he claimed in Kerry until that
claim should have been legally determined in his favour.
He further promised to pay the debts he had incurred in
England as soon as money could possibly be scraped
together.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Elizabeth
gives advice
to
Desmond
and his
brother.</div>

<p>The Queen granted the brothers an interview before their
departure, professed herself satisfied with the Earl&#8217;s plain
speech and good intentions, &#8216;and to Sir John she gave a
privy nip, that as he hath a good wit, so he should hereafter
use it well. He, like one not unwise nor unexpert, craved
pardon, if anything heretofore were amiss, all should be
amended.&#8217; Burghley lectured Sir John again, at greater
length no doubt, and after a further delay of some weeks,
caused probably by the Queen&#8217;s dislike to do anything in
Burghley&#8217;s absence, the restored exiles were forwarded to
Ireland in charge of Fitton, who had been appointed Vice-Treasurer,
and the settlement of whose quarrel with Clanricarde
was referred to the friendly offices of the Lord Deputy and
Council. Fitzwilliam had directions to do nothing without
consulting Perrott, and Perrott had been much averse to
Desmond&#8217;s return. Rejoicing in his freedom, Desmond
slipped through Wales, and Fitton heard nothing of him till
he reached Beaumaris. Perhaps the released prisoner expected
what actually happened, and had some half-formed
plan of sailing before the Vice-Treasurer and reaching
Munster without running the gauntlet of the Dublin politicians.
Sir Thomas Smith had indeed given the sound advice
that, &#8216;seeing her Majesty doth mind to tie the Earl to her
service with a benefit, it should be <i>ample, liberaliter et prolixe</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
done, not <i>maligne et parce</i>, which doth so disgrace it, that for
love many a time it leaveth a grudge beyond in the heart of
him which should receive it that mars the whole benefit.&#8217;
But other counsels prevailed, and Desmond was detained for
many months in Dublin&mdash;a proceeding by no means calculated
to cause a lively sense of benefits conferred.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Walter,
Earl of
Essex.</div>

<p>Having desperately resolved to pacify Munster by sending
Desmond home, the Queen made haste to create disturbance
in Ulster by licensing private conquest on a large scale.
Smith had evidently failed, but she persuaded herself that
another might succeed if only he were adequately supported.
It was an age when nothing seemed impossible to the brave,
and all men&#8217;s minds ran upon vague schemes of conquest,
beyond unfathomed seas and over unmeasured lands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His antecedents.</div>

<p>A Raleigh and a Stukeley differed widely in moral and
intellectual stature, but they were not without such a generic
likeness as a horse bears to a donkey, or a lion to a cat. A
vulgar projector like Chatterton and a rash speculator like
young Smith could do much harm and could hardly do any
good; but one of the most romantic and chivalrous of English
nobles was now about to risk his all upon the fatal shore where
Randolph had lost his life and Sussex had endangered his reputation.
Walter Devereux, Viscount Hereford, having married
Lettice, daughter of Sir F. Knollys, was first employed to prevent
Mary Stuart&#8217;s escape from Tutbury, but found a better
opportunity of distinction in Northumberland&#8217;s insurrection.
He raised a troop of horse, and acted as marshal of the royal
army. Few or none of the old nobility had shown so much
zeal, and the Queen rewarded him with a garter and with
the earldom of Essex, a title which had been borne by his
ancestors. He now offered to show his gratitude by conquering
a province for her Majesty at his own risk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He proposes
to colonise
part of
Ulster.</div>

<p>As a preliminary step he required a grant from the Crown
in fee of the whole of what is now the county of Antrim,
bounded by the sea from Belfast to Coleraine, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
land side by the Bann and Lough Neagh, and including the
island of Rathlin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His demands.</div>

<p>The race of Hugh Boy O&#8217;Neill and the Scots claimants
were not forgotten, but Essex asked for authority by martial
law over the whole of them, as well as over his own followers.
All fisheries, including those of the Bann and Lough Neagh,
and all tithes and other spiritualities were to be comprised
in the grant, and a commercial monopoly, free of customs
for seven years, was to be secured to the settlers. Essex
demanded the right to make galley-slaves of all Irish and
Scots convicted&mdash;by martial law as it seems&mdash;of treason or
felony, to make war and peace, and to enact local laws. He
was to have all wardships and marriages, and the Dublin
government was to have no power of imposing any cess or
tax.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grant to
Essex.</div>

<p>After some haggling Essex received a grant of all Antrim
except the lands belonging to the chartered townsmen of
Carrickfergus, the town and castle, and 1,000 acres for their
support. He was freed from all cesses for seven years, and
none of his tenants were to be obliged to serve in war beyond
the limits of his grant. The grantee had unlimited power of
alienation to men of English birth, and authority for twelve
years to make new subdivisions or to rename old ones. He
had all manorial rights except pleas of the Crown, and the
freedom of all markets in Ireland for himself and his tenants.
Free trade was granted with all lands in amity with the
Queen for seven years. The patentee had power to give leave
of absence to English tenants for twelve years on the appointment
of a substitute, and to admit 100 foreigners as
denizens. The Queen agreed to furnish 200 horse and 400
foot, the Earl providing a like number; and each party was
bound to keep those numbers up. Costs of fortification were
to be divided in the same way. Among the few things not
granted were gold and silver mines, and the right to coin
money. The consideration offered for this enormous grant
consisted of the services to be rendered and of property
amounting to 800 marks, left him by the Earl of March&#8217;s will&mdash;a
will of which the validity was disputed. Unpromising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
as this scheme must have appeared to many of those who
knew Ireland best, it was advocated by Burghley, Sussex, and
Leicester; and when failure threatened, Elizabeth accused
them of having persuaded her against her better judgment.
Sir Thomas Smith, in spite of his experience, was also in
favour of the project.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Great alarm
in Ulster.
Fitzwilliam
disapproves
the project.</div>

<p>In spite of Fitzwilliam&#8217;s efforts to keep it quiet, the intended
expedition was talked of in Ireland almost as soon as
in London. The Lord Deputy earnestly begged that action
might follow quickly, since the interval would certainly be
filled with lies and cavillings. One cause of delay was that
Essex had no ready money. The Queen was, however, willing
to lend 10,000<i>l.</i> as first mortgagee of his property in
Bucks and Essex, worth 500<i>l.</i> a year. Nor was the bargain
a bad one. In less than one year 1,000<i>l.</i> was to be repaid,
and in default, land worth 50<i>l.</i> a year was to be forfeited.
There was the same penalty for not paying a second 1,000<i>l.</i>
within two years; and if the whole 10,000<i>l.</i> were not repaid
within three years, then the entire property pledged was to
fall to the Queen. A further cause of delay was Burghley&#8217;s
desire for fuller information. Since the days of Henry VII.
it had been the custom to send special commissioners in cases
where the ordinary official reports were likely to be prejudiced
or tainted, and Burghley now despatched Edmund Tremayne
with instructions to investigate necessary matters and to
return quickly, leaving to Fitzwilliam all that could not be
done in a hurry. Tremayne, who knew Ireland well, was
strongly impressed with the advantages of speed and secrecy,
but he saw that much delay was unavoidable, and advised
that the Earl should put forth rumours of the plan being indefinitely
postponed. He was particularly anxious that the
whole force should come together, lest the Irish might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
tempted to cut off isolated bands. A servant of Essex who
had brought letters to Maltby, Piers, and Smith, was sent
back so as to give colour to the report of a postponement.
But Lord Rich with 100 men, Sir Peter Carew and Sir
Arthur Champernowne with forty each, and other gentlemen
with smaller companies, could hardly make their arrangements
secretly; nor could much promptitude be expected from
such a heterogeneous body. For the Earl himself there had
to be provided six pieces of artillery, much powder and match,
trenching tools, 150 calivers, sixty muskets, 200 bows, and
two surgeons at 16<i>s.</i> per month. &#8216;I understand,&#8217; wrote Sir
John Perrott, who had a Pembrokeshire quarrel with the noble
adventurer, &#8216;that the Earl of Essex, with a great rout, intendeth
the conquest of the North. For her Majesty&#8217;s service
I wish him success, but for himself I care not what cometh
thereof, for he and his friends have sought as much to discredit
me in my absence as in them lay.&#8217; Neither Perrott
nor Fitzwilliam were in love with the chivalric interloper, but
they do not appear to have thwarted him; indeed, the Queen
specially thanked the former for his friendly tone. Her
instinct probably told her that men who had borne the burden
and heat of the day with but little reward would hardly be
prejudiced in favour of this courtly amateur.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Essex is
sanguine.</div>

<p>Confident in Burghley&#8217;s support, Essex made light of
opposition. The Lord Deputy he had &#8216;ever loved and liked
well of,&#8217; though the conversation of his friends at Court did
not foreshadow his support. But the Queen was all smiles
and promises, and advised the Earl &#8216;to have consideration of
the Irish there, which she thought had become her disobedient
subjects rather because they have not been defended
from the force of the Scots, than for any other cause,&#8217; and
not to seek too hastily the conversion of a people who had
been trained in another religion. He answered that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
&#8216;would not willingly imbrue his hands with more blood than
the necessity of the cause requireth,&#8217; and that, when once the
Irish had been brought to due obedience, &#8216;they would be
easily brought to be of good religion.&#8217; He was not destined
to find either task particularly easy.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Essex sails,
1573.
Gentlemen
adventurers.</div>

<p>Having taken leave of Elizabeth on July 19, 1573, Essex
sailed from Liverpool on August 16, accompanied by Lords
Rich and Darcy, and with enough men and stores to fill
several vessels. They were blown down Channel, some as far
as Cork, but the Earl managed to land on one of the Copeland
Islands, whence he made his way to Carrickfergus: here he
was joined by Lord Rich, who, having got ashore at Kilcleif,
near the mouth of Lough Strangford, travelled under Maltby&#8217;s
escort by way of Belfast. Others were forced to the Isle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
of Man. A large part of the soldiers still lingered in England
waiting for wine and other supplies; and Essex found himself
powerless to effect anything considerable. But he put
on a bold face, told Tirlogh Luineach that he was come to
free the Irish from the tyranny of the Scots aliens, and that
he might find grace by helping the work, but that otherwise
he would waste him with fire and sword. The Earl advanced
to the Bann without meeting an enemy, but the inherent
disadvantage of making war by private contract soon became
apparent. The Scots withdrew behind the river, and reminded
Essex of the fact that he had no military authority
outside the bounds of his grant.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">At first
things look
promising.</div>

<p>The adventurous Earl&#8217;s first impression was, however,
favourable; for Sir Brian MacPhelim wrote to say that,
though he had never seen him, he knew of the forces which
accompanied him, and of those which were still to come. Sir
Brian asked what terms he might expect if he returned to
his allegiance; and Essex answered that he would make
none, but that simple and immediate submission might give
a first claim on her Majesty&#8217;s clemency. Sir Brian then
sought an interview with Captain Piers, and, accompanied by
that officer, came into Carrickfergus, &#8216;and in the most public
part of the house did on his knees make his submission,
alleging little for himself, but some unkindness towards Mr.
Smith,&#8217; and desiring oblivion and mercy in consideration of
services to come. &#8216;When I had somewhat aggravated, to
make her Majesty&#8217;s mercy the greater, I took him by hand,
as a sign of his restitution to her Highness&#8217;s service; with
promise to commend any desert of his hereafter.&#8217; Sir Brian&#8217;s
cattle were in the Route, the district between the Bush and
the Bann, and as sole security for their owner&#8217;s performance
Essex had them driven into the fields about Carrickfergus,
where he supposed them to be in perfect safety. The chief
talked pleasantly of his hostility to the Scots, and proposed
to submit a plan for entrapping those who had sought to
rebel in his company. The Irish generally professed great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
joy at the strict orders issued by the Earl against injuring
them or taking their goods without full payment, and at
being allowed not only to reap their own corn, but also
what belonged to the Scots. On the whole, the natives
appeared admirably disposed, and great praise was due
to Captain Piers and Captain Maltby for their ability and
diligence.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">But the
O&#8217;Neills
soon show
their real
sentiment.</div>

<p>So things went on, and for more than a fortnight all was
merry as a marriage bell, while Sir Brian had ample opportunities
of measuring the invader&#8217;s real weakness. Then
someone hinted to Essex that cows were moveable property,
and that he had better be on his guard. Piers was accordingly
sent with 100 mounted men to drive the stock close
together in the immediate neighbourhood of the castle, and
he returned saying that all was fast, that at least 10,000 head
were in sight, and that he had left trusty scouts who would
find out what was going on, and give twelve hours&#8217; notice of
any intended mischief. The Earl said that he had his suspicions;
but either this was an afterthought or Piers was
the reverse of vigilant, for it was three o&#8217;clock next day
before he found out that Sir Brian had withdrawn his horned
hostages twelve or fourteen hours before, having bribed the
scouts to say nothing about it. Five hundred Scots had
landed at Lough Foyle, and Sir Brian hastened to join his
forces to those of Tirlogh Luineach. Irish and Scots combined
might hope to escape the common enemy. The Earl
mounted at once, and spurred after Sir Brian for fourteen
miles, when he was overtaken by night. The cattle reached
the shelter of thick woods, and Essex returned to learn that
many of the townsmen were in the plot. He imprisoned
several, and regretted deeply that he had no power to execute
them. In his rage and disappointment he professed to be
glad that Sir Brian had thrown off the mask, &#8216;for now I have
no occasion to trust the Irish, whereby I might have been
more abused, than by open force I shall.... My first
actions showed nothing but lenity, plainness, and an equal
care of both nations; my next shall show more severity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
justice abroad, and less trust at home.&#8217; It needed but small
experience of Irish life to turn a Quixote into something not
very unlike a Pizarro; and Sir Peter Carew did not conceal
his joy that the true nature of the natives was now manifest,
and that the danger of their being overmuch trusted was at
an end.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Young
Smith is
killed.</div>

<p>The force collected at Carrickfergus consisted of 600 foot,
200 horse, 100 labourers, and 200 kerne. The adventurers
were nominally 400 strong, but most of them were still in
England; 200 soldiers raised in Somersetshire arrived armed
with white sticks, though it was said that Captain Barkley
had 400<i>l.</i> for an outfit. The Northern horse, under Captain
Selby, complained that they were brought to a desert and
that they could not live on their pay, and the foot grumbled
at having to give fourpence sterling for rations. Provisions
began to run short, and it became necessary to fight even for
the free passage of cows out of Lecale. The escort sent to
convoy them were attacked by Scots in the pass between
Carrickfergus and Belfast, and after four hours&#8217; skirmishing
found the Laggan flooded and had to return. Had it not
been for the intercession of Sussex, who remembered what
he himself had endured in Ulster, it is probable that Essex
would have had nothing but water and beef, and not too
much of the latter; while the corn which he had at great
expense provided was diverted by the Bristol traders to
some more profitable use. Still, he was master in the field,
though he sought in vain for anything like a general engagement.
Once Sir Brian ventured into the neighbourhood with
his herds, which had eaten up the grass in Northern Antrim,
and Essex set upon them near Massereene with 300 or 400
horse. The Baron of Dungannon did good service, William
Norris behaved with the utmost gallantry, and his brother
John showed the qualities which afterwards made him famous.
The result was a prey of 400 cows and the slaughter of some
forty kerne and cowherds. &#8216;But if I had been well guided,&#8217;
said Essex, &#8216;or if my footmen had been come unto me, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
were then three miles from me, I had taken 10,000 of his
kine, and caught Brian and his company at a great disadvantage.&#8217;
Much virtue in If. He returned from this not
very glorious foray to find that his precursor and ally, the
unlucky Smith, had been slain that day &#8216;by the revolting
of certain Irishmen of his own household, to whom he overmuch
trusted, whereof one being retained by a rebel did kill
him with a shot.&#8217; The remnant of his men were unable to
hold out at Comber, and sent to the Earl for help, but 200
of his kerne took the opportunity to mutiny, and he could do
nothing. A few days later Essex reached Lough Strangford,
only to find Comber in ashes. The friendly Savages had led
Smith&#8217;s men into the peninsula of Ards. Sir Brian was fully
avenged of the authors of those printed books which had filled
him with such alarm. Smith&#8217;s patent remained in force during
Elizabeth&#8217;s life, and gave some trouble, but nothing serious
was ever attempted under it.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Return of
Desmond.
He is detained
in
Dublin,
1573.</div>

<p>Fitton and Desmond arrived in Dublin on Lady Day, and
the Earl was first detained until the arrival of the Lord
President. Perrott had always been against his leaving
England, and, being therefore in no hurry to reach Dublin,
he proceeded leisurely to beat out the embers of rebellion
before he should be practically superseded. The late insurgents
professed much fear lest the Earl should mislike their
yielding after standing out so long. The Lord President
could, however, say that ways were safe, that towns were no
longer straitly shut up, that Kilmallock was rebuilt, and
that he had protected no rebel who had not first submitted.
He had taken no provision at the Queen&#8217;s price, but
had bought all in a high market, greatly to his own loss; for
no horseman could really support himself and two horses, and
keep his arms and armour in order for 6-3/4<i>d.</i> a day. There
were complaints that he had interfered too much in Tipperary,
although James Tobin, Ormonde&#8217;s sheriff, had contumeliously
refused to execute his warrants for treason, a matter entirely
outside the palatinate jurisdiction. Tipperary was in con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>sequence
the most disordered part of Munster. Forty-five
malefactors were executed at Limerick, and Perrott proposed
to do the like at Cashel and Clonmel; at the latter place
confining himself to offences committed outside Ormonde&#8217;s
jurisdiction. Nor was much lost by such forbearance, for,
whatever may have been that Earl&#8217;s faults, he had not
been remiss in the way of executions. Independently of
what the Butlers had done, the Lord President could report
that he had killed or hanged 800 persons with the loss of
only eighteen Englishmen. The wonder is that between
sword and halter there was any able-bodied man left in
Munster.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Perrott in
Munster.</div>

<p>When Perrott had done his hanging he went to Dublin and
reported that Desmond was devoid of reason, and that nothing
could be done with him. The Earl, however, declared that
the unreasonableness was in the Government, who demanded
of him more than he had promised, and when he made fresh
promises refused to accept them. His right to a palatinate
jurisdiction in Kerry was held void by the lawyers; he was
ready to exercise it only according to her Majesty&#8217;s pleasure,
and without engrafting any Irish customs upon it, and he
made no objection to the establishment of courts leet and
courts baron. As to coyne and livery, he would forego them
for six months, pending the decision of his cause. He was
more willing than able to abolish them permanently, but
was quite ready to agree to such a reasonable composition
as impartial commissioners might agree upon. On the other
hand, he demanded immediate restoration to his country, and
all castles which he claimed either as owner or mortgagee,
except Castlemartyr and Castlemaine, which were reserved
to the Queen. This was all very well; but Desmond gave
out generally that there would be no more Presidents after
Christmas, and this was hardly the way to conciliate Perrott,
who had a veto upon all Munster matters. Sir John Fitzgerald
was more pliable or more politic than the Earl, and
he risked little by loyal professions, for nothing that he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
or said really committed the Geraldine connection. On
promising to put down the Brehon law, to suffer no composition
for felony, and to abstain from gathering rhymers
and dicers about him, he was allowed to return into Munster,
leaving his brother to endure &#8216;an easy restraint for a little
time.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
reforms.</div>

<p>There was probably some vain hope that Sir John would
remit enough money to pay the debts incurred in England&mdash;a
subject about which there was much correspondence, and
which seems to have been thought nearly as important as
the state of Munster. Perrott went to Cork, where the
sessions were well attended and where he executed sixty
more persons. This, though quite a matter of course, was
recorded with satisfaction; but the Lord President took far
greater pride in having forced the men to give up their
glibbes and in having bullied or coaxed the gentlewomen
into foregoing the great rolls which they wore on their heads.
&#8216;By wading into this further danger,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I am assured
to have no wife in these parts, and for England when I re-embark
I look there to have none. For all my gains here is
for every white hair that I brought over with me sixty, and
a thin purse, how great soever the report went of things that
came to my hand by the Marseillyan ship.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Case of a
Marseilles
ship.</div>

<p>This vessel, the &#8216;Peter and Paul,&#8217; belonging to Marseilles,
but laden at Lisbon with a rich cargo of pepper, ginger,
cinnamon, nutmeg, soap, salad oil, sugar, &#8216;grains,&#8217; and cotton-wool,
arrived at Youghal in November 1572. She had forty
persons on board, chiefly Portuguese, but among them were
an Englishman, a Neapolitan, and two French passengers.
Fitzwilliam, upon some report of a general restraint of trade
with Spain, which might include Portugal, sent a commission
to Perrott to detain the ship and to sell the cargo. At
Youghal it might have been impossible to protect her from
Piper and Garratt, two of the many pirates who at this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
infested British waters, and she was brought round to Cork,
where the men were billeted on the aldermen and allowed
the run of the city. Perrott petitioned for a grant of the
cargo, but the owners, who were wholly or partly French,
complained to the Queen. Proceedings followed in the
Admiralty, and the goods were not sold; but the ship was
found to be rotten, and had to be unladen. This was carefully
done: every article was scrupulously accounted for, and
the foreigners certified that nothing had been extorted from
them by way of ransom. It is the fate of every active
provincial governor to have many detractors among the stay-at-homes,
and Perrott&#8217;s enemies raised a cry at Court accusing
him of making away with the cargo. His defence was
complete and perfectly satisfactory to the Government, but
he continued to be troubled about it for some time, and the
voluminous correspondence extant shows how great was the
commotion excited.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Carew is

<p>As if Munster had not troubles enough, an attempt was
made at this time to revive Sir Peter Carew&#8217;s shadowy claim
to a principality there, and some of the projectors renewed
their offers to colonise parts of the province. Fitzwilliam
referred to Perrott, who reported strongly against Carew.
The mere disclosure of his title, he said, would rouse a nest
of hornets; and he protested against a private adventurer
being allowed to break the peace which he had established
with great labour and tribulation. Sidney had three soldiers
to Fitzwilliam&#8217;s one, yet it had taxed his resources severely
to still Carew&#8217;s first commotion. It would be cheaper for the
Queen to buy him out than to let him meddle again. The
people saw clearly that what affected one would affect all, and
Sir Peter was obliged to promise not to stir further in the
matter.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

Desmond&#8217;s
restoration.</div>

<p>The more Perrott saw of Desmond the less he liked him.
He had grumbled at his return; had he known him better he
would have cried aloud. He now besought the Queen to
have him taken back to England, for he would never learn
manners in Dublin, and could do nothing but harm in
Munster. To Burghley Perrott wrote still more unrestrainedly
that the Earl was fitter to keep Bedlam than to rule
a newly reformed country. In Munster, wrote the President
proudly, the plough already laughed the unbridled rogue to
scorn, and daily improvement was visible. The poor prayed
for the Queen. The clansmen had almost given up swearing
by their lords&#8217; hands. The 8,000 or 9,000 men capable of
bearing arms honoured Elizabeth&#8217;s name, and their hands
began to wax hard in labour as their feet once did in
running to mischief. The revenue might soon be expected
to increase. &#8216;If the kings of England,&#8217; he said in language
which must have appealed very strongly to Elizabeth,
&#8216;have any one thing heavier upon their souls than others,
it is that they have not made a thorough conquest of this
realm.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Threatening

<p>The Queen gracefully thanked Perrott for his services,
begged him not to leave his post on account of his health,
and proposed to send over an English doctor who knew his
constitution. But she did not recall Desmond, who complained
loudly of his long detention and declared his good
intentions, while admitting that he had made many rash
speeches. It does not seem to have occurred to him that a
man who could not rule his tongue was hardly fit to rule a
province. In the meantime his officers left the land waste,
and seized Glin Castle in defiance of the President, whose
health obliged him to go suddenly to England without taking
the vengeance he had threatened. The highest praise which
can be given him for his government of Munster is to quote
the words which the &#8216;Four Masters&#8217; used in derision:&mdash;&#8216;The
departure of the President was lamented by the poor, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
widows, the feeble, and the unwarlike of the country.&#8217; No
sooner was his back turned than the Geraldines began to stir
ominously. James Fitzmaurice reopened his intrigues with
Spain. Finding that his wife had been writing amorous
letters to Edward Butler, he divorced her summarily and
married O&#8217;Connor Kerry&#8217;s widow, whose castle of Carrigafoyle,
&#8216;the strongest and beautifullest&#8217; in West Munster,
thus fell into his hands, and offered a ready harbour
for &#8216;Jack Spaniard.&#8217; He conferred with Clanricarde&#8217;s sons&mdash;&#8216;a
sage Parliament in God&#8217;s name&#8217;&mdash;and to this Sir
John was supposed to be privy. Fitzwilliam saw that
mischief was in the wind, and meditated a journey to
Munster, when Desmond, whose tone had been gradually
growing less submissive, cut the knot by escaping from
Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond

<p>Being sent back to England was probably what Desmond
really feared, for he afterwards said he had received letters
from England hinting at such a thing. He complained of no
harsh treatment in Dublin, where he was placed under the
Mayor&#8217;s charge, but not closely confined. Either wishing for
or dreading an escape, his gaoler told the Government that
the Earl was welcome to his house and table, but that he
would no longer answer for his safe keeping. Some say that
he was allowed out on parole, which he kept for a fortnight
and then broke. Telling the Mayor that he was going out
hunting, and that he would return at night, he went to
Grangegorman, and thence escaped by dint of riding into
Munster. He was escorted through Kildare by Rory Oge
O&#8217;More and Piers Grace, both noted brigands or guerillas, and
received in the Queen&#8217;s County by 400 O&#8217;Mores, and in
Limerick by James Fitzmaurice. At Lough Gur the Earl
and Countess lost no time about showing themselves in Irish
dress, and we cannot doubt that glibbes and rolls at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
became fashionable again. All the Geraldines hastened to
arms, &#8216;knowing no God, no Prince, but the Earl, no law but
his behests.&#8217; Desmond promptly gave out that he would
allow no sheriffs, thus practically deciding the palatinate question
in his own favour; and to all appearances he was soon as
powerful as any of his ancestors had been. Fitzwilliam wrote
to warn the fugitive that he was in great danger of losing
all, but to Burghley he confessed his fear of a great conspiracy.
The lawyers were afraid to go circuit in Munster, and not a
single councillor could be got to go to Cork, where Perrott
had lately done such execution. In a few days Castlemaine
and Castlemartyr, which had taken so much pains to reduce,
were again in Geraldine hands, and there was soon nothing
to show for Perrott&#8217;s Presidency but the gibbeted corpses of
some malefactors, and the tears of &#8216;the poor, the widows,
the feeble, and the unwarlike.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The central
district disturbed.</div>

<p>The general course of government was neither smooth nor
glorious from the time when Elizabeth determined to restore
Desmond to Ireland, until he practically carried out her first
intention by escaping from Dublin. Leix and Offaly were
almost as bad as they had ever been. In the former, Cosby
was forced by his weakness to wink at disorder. In the latter,
Henry Cowley, who was honourably distinguished as the only
English officer who really tried to rule legally, had to go to
Dublin to beg in vain for one hundred men. Without them
he hardly knew how to get back to Philipstown, outside
which he could at the best scarcely stir. The general
opinion was that the Queen meant to leave all to Irish
government. The miserable town of Athenry had been
plundered and left utterly desolate by Clanricarde&#8217;s sons, and
an alderman danced attendance on Fitzwilliam and Fitton,
begging for help which they could not give. Ormonde&#8217;s
country in his absence was scarcely better than the rebel dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>tricts,
and the Graces, who would have obeyed the Earl but
no one else, carried off Sir Barnaby Fitzpatrick&#8217;s wife and
daughter. Sir Barnaby pursued and recovered the young
lady, but her mother, who was in delicate health, spent some
miserable weeks in captivity in Tipperary and Kilkenny.
King Edward&#8217;s old companion poured forth his grief to
Sidney, and signed himself &#8216;your poor tormented friend.&#8217;
Tremayne, who had orders to make special inquiries about this
outrage, reported that Fitzwilliam had followed it up well.
But Fitzwilliam could really do very little, for old Cormac
O&#8217;Connor was again at the head of a Scotch and Irish band
who hovered between Leinster and Connaught. The force
of the country would not serve against the old chief, nor do
any damage to the native gentlemen; so that the whole brunt
fell on the scanty garrison and yet more scanty settlers.
Athlone Castle was actually entered by the rebels, and Connaught
was left to its own devices. Tremayne reported that
Clanricarde was quite unable to restrain his graceless sons.
Fitton thought his late subjects might, perhaps, by good
management be persuaded to stay quiet as long as they liked,
&#8216;which kind of quiet is no new thing in the politics of Ireland.&#8217;
Like everyone else, he attributed all to the Queen&#8217;s
ill-judged parsimony, &#8216;sparing too sparely I fear will cost
more spending.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzwilliam
and Fitton
fall out.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A
murder.</div>

<p>For most practical purposes the two chief personages in
the Irish Government at this time were the Lord Deputy and
Vice-Treasurer Fitton&mdash;the bearer of the sword and the
bearer of the purse. The way in which they worked together
was not edifying, nor calculated to impress the natives with
a sense of dignity and power. Having inquired into the
quarrel between Fitton and Clanricarde, the Lord Deputy and
Council decided that the former had made good his case, and
they patched up a precarious friendship between them. But
in the daily intercourse between hostile officials it was less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
easy to maintain a friendly appearance. Fitzwilliam was a
man of hasty temper, Fitton was said to be vain-glorious
and was certainly quarrelsome and litigious. An opportunity
for explosion was afforded by an affray between the Vice-Treasurer&#8217;s
servant Roden, a gentleman&#8217;s son&mdash;with the expectation
of one hundred marks a year, he notes, as if that
had anything to do with it&mdash;and one Burnell, a follower of
the Clerk of the Council, and a friend of Captain Harrington,
the Lord Deputy&#8217;s nephew. Roden broke Burnell&#8217;s head
with his dagger, and Harrington threatened vengeance.
According to Fitton&#8217;s account, Harrington&#8217;s servant, James
Meade, met Roden in the street some days afterwards, and
shouting &#8216;Dead, villain!&#8217; immediately ran him through the
body. The coroner&#8217;s jury found that the deed was done in
self-defence, but Meade was indicted for murder in the Queen&#8217;s
Bench, and the Grand Jury found a bill for manslaughter,
whereupon the Lord Deputy granted a general pardon, and
thus defeated both law and justice entirely. Fitton asked to
see the record of pardon, which he retained as evidence, and,
refusing to restore it, was imprisoned in the common gaol
during the Lord Deputy&#8217;s pleasure. Next day Fitzwilliam
thought better of it, and summoned the Vice-Treasurer to the
Council Board, but he refused to take his seat, declaring that he
had done nothing wrong, and that one who had been judged a
contemner of authority was unworthy to act as a councillor.
He pressed hard for a full inquiry, and the noise soon reached
the Queen&#8217;s ears, who exonerated Fitton, told him to take his
seat again fearlessly, and to repute it praise and honour that
he had suffered for doing her Majesty good service. Fitzwilliam
she rebuked sharply for giving a pardon which she
herself would have feared to grant, lest the blood of slain men
should cry vengeance upon the realm. It was generally said
in England, she informed the Irish Council, that they were
the Deputy&#8217;s tools and Fitton only a true councillor. The
Vice-Treasurer was not likely to hide the letter addressed to
himself, and the other soon got wind in spite of every effort.
To the Queen Fitzwilliam could say little but that he was undeservedly
disgraced, and longed to be recalled, but he rated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Fitton before one hundred persons, impeaching his truth and
honesty, and saying that if he kept away from the Council
Board he was but one councillor the less. Having his cue
from the Queen, Fitton dutifully attended next day, and must
be allowed on the whole to have got much the best of it.
Fitzwilliam had not the temper to conceal his feelings, though
he dared not dispute her Majesty&#8217;s decision, for he told
Burghley that the other was a deep dissembler and his professed
enemy. Malicious, false, and cowardly, he had given
him two deadly bites, and was to be distrusted for ever. &#8216;God
send me into the earth or to be tied into a dungeon rather
than to be coupled with such a venomous person.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Lord Chancellor
Weston.</div>

<p>At this critical time death deprived the Irish Government
of Lord Chancellor Weston&#8217;s services. He had held the Great
Seal for six years, respected by all the official world as a
father to the commonwealth; and the very Irishry lamented
his loss. Weston was sincerely religious, not without a tinge
of Puritanism, and was filled with anxiety at the condition of
the Irish Church. Non-resident clergymen and desecrated
churches were the rule, and he felt that he was giving a bad
example by holding the temporalities of two deaneries, Wells
in England and St. Patrick&#8217;s in Ireland. It was thus that
scanty salaries were eked out both before and after the Reformation.
His conscientious scruples aggravated his naturally
weak health, mainly caused, as he believed, by the damp
climate, more probably by the want of vegetables and by unskilful
physicians. He left a widow who appears to have
been worthy of him, and an equally virtuous daughter, who
was married first to Brady, Bishop of Meath, and afterwards
to Secretary Fenton. Catherine Fenton, the only daughter
of this second marriage, whilst in her nurse&#8217;s arms, consented
in childish play to be the wife of Richard Boyle, afterwards
Earl of Cork. Many years later Boyle, a widower of four
years&#8217; standing, actually married the &#8216;little lady&#8217; with whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
he had played in his bachelor days. That she inherited the
virtues of her mother, grandmother, and grandfather, may be
inferred from the beautiful passage in which one of the most
powerful and successful men of his time has recorded his
debt to his second wife. &#8216;I never,&#8217; he says, &#8216;demanded any
marriage portion, neither had promise of any, it not being in
my consideration; yet her father after my marriage gave me
1,000<i>l.</i> in gold with her; but the gift of his daughter unto
me I must ever thankfully acknowledge as the crown of all
my blessings; for she was a most religious, virtuous, loving,
and obedient wife unto me all the days of her life, and the
happy mother of all my hopeful children, who, with their
posterity, I beseech God to bless.&#8217; Among the children were
the famous Orrery, and the yet more famous Robert Boyle.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

intrigues.
Rowland
Turner.</div>

<p>The relations of England both with France and Spain
were at this time extremely strained, and Antonio de Gueras,
the Spanish Commissioner in London, thought the expedition
of Essex might be turned to good purpose. The
English refugees in Spain and the Low Countries kept
pressing Philip to invade Ireland, and Rowland Turner, calling
himself Lord Audley, an English priest from Louvain,
was sent to Ulster with letters from De Gueras to Sir Brian
MacPhelim. Essex, the Spaniard wrote, was about to land
with 3,000 men and to exterminate the O&#8217;Neills. In order
to frustrate his plan, Sir Brian was advised to put himself
under the direction of Turner, a prudent, worthy, and faithful
Catholic gentleman, with 500 splendidly armed men
awaiting his orders in England. Turner, who had lately
been in Spain, Scotland, and the Isle of Man, was well
known to the English Government; and his foolish boasts
about hanging all Protestants were not likely to enhance his
reputation for ability or discretion. Sir Brian, though very
willing to keep off Essex, had no idea of directly opposing
Queen Elizabeth, nor of engaging in &oelig;cumenical plots for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the extirpation of heresy. Like Archbishop Fitzgibbon, he
feared that the English Catholics would make a tool of him,
and throw him away when a turn had been served. He
received Turner very coldly, who bitterly complained that he
was not believed, though an exile for God&#8217;s sake and for that
of the Irish. Captain Piers hinted to Sir Brian that Turner&#8217;s
noble blood was fabulous, and the exile, while insisting upon
his own stainless pedigree, retorted that Piers himself was
the son of a scoundrel, and unworthy of being believed on his
oath. His language, indeed, though he wrote in Latin, was
almost worthy of Marryat&#8217;s boatswain. The Irish were
wretched, beggarly paupers, the slaves of the English, who
took their cattle and fished their waters without payment,
and held all their country either by force or fraud. By
listening to Turner the natives might change all this, and
make the English their slaves for ever. But they would not
listen; and Turner shook the dust from his feet, though
Essex thought he could trace the effects of his machinations.
He was afterwards employed by Alva, and received money
from Philip, but he does not appear to have risked a second
rebuff in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Essex can
do little or
nothing.</div>

<p>After Smith&#8217;s death Essex could do little but bemoan his
hard fate and confess that the people, &#8216;to increase their own
plague, had refused her Majesty&#8217;s mercies.&#8217; The causes of
failure he thus sums up: &#8216;Two great disadvantages I find
in this little time of my continuance here. The first by the
adventurers, of whom the most part, not having forgotten the
delicacies of England, and wanting resolute minds to endure
the travail of a year or two in this waste country, have forsaken
me, feigning excuses to repair home, where I hear they
give forth speeches in dislike of the enterprise to the discouragement
of others. The second, that the common hired
soldiers, both horsemen and footmen, mislike of their pay,
and allege that they were not pressed by commission but by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
persuasion, and therefore ought not to be detained in this
service longer than they like to stay. This is not hidden from
the Irish, who also are fully persuaded that this war is altogether
mine, alleging that if it were your Majesty&#8217;s, it should
be executed by the Lord Deputy, being your chief general
here; and therefore thinking that I must be in a short time
wearied with the charge, have confederated to stand in arms,
which they would never do with your Majesty unless it were
in respect of me, whereby I must acknowledge the weakness
of myself, and so consequently of any subject that shall
attempt any great service, and therein part with his prince
either honour or profit. Therefore my humble petition is,
that, albeit the moiety of the charge be mine, according to
my covenant with your Majesty, that yet some means may
be devised that all the officers, soldiers, and dealers in this
war may seem to be your Majesty&#8217;s; the war yours, and the
reformation your Majesty&#8217;s, and I only the instrument and
executor of this service; whereby all men shall either put on
better contentations and new courages, or else I with better
warrant may punish the mutiny and the base ignobility of
the soldiers&#8217; minds.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Falstaffian

<p>The Devon and Somerset men, under Captain Burrowes,
showed a particularly craven spirit, and began to desert at
the prospect of active service. Essex hanged a few without
much effect, for they preferred both starving and hanging
to fighting. This is not surprising when we consider how
they were recruited. The Privy Council directed the
Western gentlemen to call for volunteers, and in default of
a response to press those whom the country could best spare.
Of course they sent all the greatest blackguards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish

but defend their own lands and goods.&#8217; The English, moreover,

peace at home,&#8217; and unable to cope with the Irish, who, while
retaining their native hardiness, had become skilled in the
use of weapons. The task was too great for any but the
Queen, though Essex was one to go through with his undertaking
even at the cost of his earldom. He &#8216;shot not at the
gain and revenue of the matter, but rather for the honour
and credit of the cause.&#8217; It is not in this poetic fashion that
flourishing colonies have been founded, nor was the Earl himself
sanguine, for he sent a trusty messenger to England with
a detailed account of his troubles; and indeed nothing could
be worse than the aspect of affairs, especially after the escape
of Desmond had made it hopeless to expect help from the

<p>Essex could do nothing against the enemy, but some
whom he considered lukewarm friends were more within his
power. Piers, being accused of giving information to Sir
Brian, was closely imprisoned and treated with excessive
harshness, though there does not appear to have been any
evidence against him. Nor was Fitzwilliam spared, for the
Irish very reasonably held that if the war was the Queen&#8217;s
the army should be led by the Queen&#8217;s Deputy, and it is probable
that that experienced officer was of the same opinion
himself. Essex professed readiness to serve under him as
a private adventurer, but in the meantime accused him of
encouraging libels against Burghley and himself. &#8216;He could
be contented to hear me ill spoken of openly in his chamber
by his own servants, and he to show countenance, as though
he took pleasure in his man&#8217;s words ... he can be contented
to sit in his chair and smile; and because I see
further that all the Irish messengers of Ulster are daily with
his lordship and I no way made privy to their petitions, or
causes of their coming thither, I conclude that underhand
many things may pass to my disadvantage, for already, whatsoever
I require at any Irishman&#8217;s hands, he appealeth to the
Lord Deputy.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Captain Wilsford thought that Ulster was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
about the quietest part of Ireland, and it is likely that
Fitzwilliam, besides a not unnatural jealousy, thought it
extremely unreasonable that with the scanty forces at his
disposal he should be in any way called upon to advance
the Northern enterprise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Marward
abduction
case.</div>

<p>The carrying off of the Fitzpatrick ladies had created
much stir at the English Court, on account of the high
position of the victims. That, however, was in a remote
part of the country, and the captives were detained as
hostages only. The story of an abduction of the day throws
more light upon the state of society than any number of
political disquisitions. Janet Marward, heiress and titular
baroness of Skryne in Meath, a manor worth some 200<i>l.</i>
a year, was a royal ward, and the Queen gave her wardship
to Fitzwilliam, who sold it to her stepfather, Nicholas Nugent,
second Baron of the Exchequer. Her mother, besides being
married to a judge, was the daughter of a judge, John Plunket,
Chief Justice of the Queen&#8217;s Bench. Nugent sold the unfortunate
girl to his nephew, the Baron of Delvin&#8217;s brother.
&#8216;Afterwards, by procurement of the mother, the maid, being
but eleven years old, was made to mislike of Nugent and to
like of the young Lord of Dunsany, being of the Plunkets,
whereupon there fell great discord between the Houses of
Delvin and Dunsany, and the maid being by her mother
and father-in-law brought into this city as the safest place
to keep her, on Friday last at night about twelve o&#8217;clock
the Baron of Delvin&#8217;s brother, accompanied with a number
of armed men, the watch being either negligent or corrupted,
entered one of the postern gates of the city with twenty
swords and entered by sleight into the house where the maid
lay, and forcibly carried her away, to the great terror of the
mother and of all the rest.&#8217; William Nugent married the
heiress without her own consent or that of her friends. But
we may hope that in time she got to &#8216;like of&#8217; her lawless
husband tolerably well, for when he was in prison for conspiracy
nine years after it is recorded that she sent him some
shirts. With such things going on under the very shadow
of Dublin Castle, it is no wonder that Fitzwilliam should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
clamour for recall or that he should regret the hard fate
of his three marriageable daughters, who were losing their
time in Ireland. Had they been heiresses and royal wards
their lot might have been still harder.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
will not go
to the Lord
Deputy.</div>

<p>The escape of Desmond had made a great difference in the
state of Ireland, for no chief either in north or south could
afford to neglect such a factor in insular politics. Clanricarde,
being invited by him to a conference, informed the
Government that he would, if possible, persuade him to conformity.
Desmond also sought Sir Edmund Butler, who was
now sincerely loyal, and made to him a general denial of rebellious
intentions. Butler advised him to go to the Lord
Deputy and make his peace, but this he would not do. &#8216;Sir
Edmund Butler,&#8217; he said, &#8216;if you had known what extremity
I had suffered in England, you would never give me the like
counsel.&#8217; And to clench the argument he exhibited the
patched and pieced hose and shoes which he had been forced
to wear continually in England. Sir Edmund answered that
he had suffered much more, but was now at liberty by her
Majesty&#8217;s grace. Desmond would not willingly confess himself
disloyal, yet it is plain that he liked Queen Elizabeth
best at a distance.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">He goes
about with
a great
following.</div>

<p>With humble men, or with those whom he believed
friendly, the Earl was less guarded, and made no secret of his
intention to annoy the Butlers and their friends, and he said
he would rather have an old mantle in Munster than a torn
silk gown in England. He went about with a rabble of 800
or 900, so that peaceable folk wished they had accompanied
Perrott to England or drowned themselves at his departure.
The Barrys and Roches had to support his lawless train,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
though the influence of the Countess and others for a time
prevented open plunder; but Desmond refused to reduce his
followers while Bourchier remained in garrison at Kilmallock.
The townsmen were not to be trusted, and ladders were being
prepared in the woods. Even Cork refused to support nine
soldiers, though a regular warrant was produced, and James
Fitzmaurice&#8217;s attitude was very threatening; for he made
little secret of hiring Scots, and a Scots visitor ostentatiously
donned Irish attire. But there was no lack of loyal professions.
&#8216;Before God, Mr. Walshe,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I do not intend
it, nor will do harm to any man unless I am compelled.&#8217;
Another less noted partisan appeared before Castlemaine on
Christmas Eve with thirty sword and target men. The
porter, either corrupted or a sympathiser, had furnished the
assailants with impressions of the keys in dough, and new keys
had been made. The Geraldines entered quietly, and found
the garrison playing cards. They turned them out, taking
back such as were willing to change masters. Desmond,
three days later, reported that the castle had been taken
without his orders and against his will, that he had put in
warders of his own, and arrested the adventurers who had
seized the place. About the same time the seneschal of
Imokilly took possession of Castlemartyr. Rumours of rebellion
and foreign invasion filled the air, and merchants who
had seen golden visions of Irish prosperity informed Burghley
that the escape of Desmond had spoiled all.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mission of
Edward
Fitzgerald,
1574.</div>

<p>The importance of Desmond&#8217;s escape was not lost on the
English Government, and it was resolved to send a semi-official
messenger to remonstrate with him in a friendly way.
The person chosen was Kildare&#8217;s brother Edward, Lieutenant
of the Gentleman Pensioners, and no doubt it was supposed
that his name and blood would recommend him to Desmond.
There had probably been a close acquaintance between them
in England. Fitzgerald had a regular commission from the
Queen, but she desired him to write always to his wife or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
sister, so as to keep up the appearance of a private tour. The
experienced courtier may have thought the matter too weighty
for women, for he wrote all privately to Burghley. As a
precaution 300 men were ordered to Ireland, and others were
held in readiness. Rather more than 6,000<i>l.</i> was sent in
money, with strict injunctions that it should be spent on the
exigencies of the moment, and not on satisfying creditors.
This new way of paying old debts was not found practicable.
The money was quickly spent, and in less than two months
the Irish Government was asking for more.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">He seeks
vainly for
a meeting
with
Desmond.</div>

<p>If Elizabeth really imagined that her Lieutenant of Pensioners,
who had been little if at all in Ireland since his
childhood, could travel as a private gentleman without
attracting notice, the notion was quickly dispelled. The
Irish Government treated him in all respects as a Royal
Commissioner, and furnished him with careful instructions.
The Munster rivers were flooded, and there was a difficulty
about corresponding with Desmond. He professed himself
ready to meet his kinsman near Clonmel on the last day of
January, but declined to go to Dublin, and stiffly maintained
that he was ready to prove all that he had ever asserted
against the Lord Deputy or Sir John Perrott. There was no
want of information as to Desmond&#8217;s evil intentions. Patrick
Sherlock, sheriff of Waterford, a stout old campaigner who
had served the Emperor and the King of France, warned the
English Government that all malcontents, north and south,
were banded together, and that they would soon have 3,000
men in the field. The Earl of Ormonde and 1,000 English
soldiers was Sherlock&#8217;s prescription. Justice Walshe was
much of the same opinion, and so was Maurice O&#8217;Brien,
Bishop-Elect of Killaloe, a Cambridge man, who had become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
more English than the English, and who declared that it
would be better to be a prisoner in England than a free man
in Ireland. Mulroney O&#8217;Carroll informed the seneschal of
Queen&#8217;s County that a messenger of Desmond&#8217;s had been at
his house, and after drinking much whiskey had told him of
letters sent by the Earl to O&#8217;Neill, Clanricarde, the O&#8217;Mores,
O&#8217;Connors, and O&#8217;Byrnes. Shane Burke, with 600 Scots,
was to harry the King&#8217;s and Queen&#8217;s Counties. O&#8217;Carroll,
who addressed Cosby as his father, admitted that the truth
was obscure, and that servants often exceeded it in speaking
of their masters; but he confirmed the man&#8217;s story to some
extent, and stated that a flood in the Shannon had alone
prevented Desmond from meeting Clanricarde. Anxiety for
this meeting was believed to be the cause of Desmond&#8217;s delay
in meeting Fitzgerald. All accounts agreed that there was
to be a general attack on the English settlers, that Desmond
would have no president or other English official resident
if he could help it, and that he aspired to be rather a tributary
sovereign than a subject.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
meeting
takes
place, but
is not of
much use.</div>

<p>So far as any secrecy went, Edward Fitzgerald might as
well have had his commission read with tuck of drum in
every town and village. His unostentatious mode of travelling
merely gave an excuse for not treating him with much
respect. At Clonmel the municipality refused him livery for
his horses; he was obliged to forage for himself, and he had
to wait long before Desmond would take the trouble to meet
him. Seven articles founded upon the instructions of the
Irish Government were propounded to the Earl. His answers
were not considered altogether dutiful, and by the advice of
some English gentlemen in his company Fitzgerald gave him
an opportunity of amending them. Thus, he at first refused
to be judged in any way by the Lord Deputy or Lord
President, they having a private grudge against him. On
second thoughts he said nothing about Perrott and Fitzwilliam,
but merely pleaded his poverty, his previous long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
detention, and his doubts as to &#8216;indifference of hearing&#8217; there,
as reasons for not visiting Dublin. But if &#8216;such of the
Council as were indifferent&#8217; would come to the borders of his
country, he was ready to agree to anything reasonable. Of
general professions of loyalty the Earl was lavish enough,
but when it came to material guarantees there was less compliance.
He was ready to give up castles to his cousin, Mr.
Edward Fitzgerald, who had no warrant to take them and
no means of holding them, but not to Captain Bourchier,
who had both. And he expressly saved all the liberties
to which he laid claim. James Fitzmaurice, Sir John of
Desmond, and Andrew Skiddy, Judge of the Palatinate of
Kerry, were among those who signed the Earl&#8217;s amended
answer.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzgerald&#8217;s
report.

Desmond&#8217;s
excuses.</div>

<p>Fitzgerald reported &#8216;that such of the Earl&#8217;s blood and
kindred as stand in danger of the law do persuade him that his
state, by reason of his departure from Dublin, is most dangerous,
and therefore they do advise the Earl, for their safeguards,
to receive a general pardon for him and them, which if they
may not procure, it seemeth they are bent to work what in
them lieth to cause the Earl to stand upon terms.&#8217; Desmond
seemed to fear an invasion of his country, and his kinsman
did what he could, which was very little, to persuade him
that no such invasion was meant. The instinct of the
Geraldines was truer than the courtier&#8217;s smooth phrases, for
on the very day fixed for the meeting Elizabeth wrote to
Fitzwilliam, blaming him sharply for lying still in Dublin
and giving the Earl so much scope. She was about to send
over Sir John Perrott with 300 men, and suggested that in
the meantime the independent lords and gentlemen of Munster
might be encouraged to make war against Desmond, and
authorised to take coyne and livery for the purpose. Perrott
had already shown what his views were, and it was no doubt
well known in Munster that Fitzwilliam had urgently besought
his return. But either the Lord President excused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
himself on the ground of ill-health, or the Queen&#8217;s humour
changed, for she accepted Desmond&#8217;s answer, though not
very graciously, and encouraged him to hope for pardon and
favour.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
is anxious
about
Ulster.</div>

<p>About the time that Essex was sending over Waterhouse,
the attention of Elizabeth and her Ministers seems suddenly
to have been directed to Ulster. The Queen woke up to the
fact that there was little hope of revenue, and not much of
military success. The discomfited adventurers had spread
hostile reports, and intending colonists were reduced to the
state of mind which the perusal of a famous novel may be
supposed to have had upon many who had thought of seeking
their fortunes upon the banks of the Mississippi. Essex was
desired to send some one who could resolve the Queen&#8217;s
doubts, both as to the actual state of Ulster and as to its
prospects for the future. Two trusty messengers were accordingly
sent, Essex not concealing his opinion that force
alone could reduce the North. Sir Brian MacPhelim might
express contrition for his former conduct, but the natives
generally were &#8216;false of their word,&#8217; and in the absence of
a strong force nothing less than a general revolt was to be
looked for.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzwilliam
has orders
to help
Essex.</div>

<p>Owing, perhaps, to the exertions of Waterhouse, or possibly
to some qualm of conscience in her Majesty as to the
ruin which was overtaking her faithful servant&#8217;s private
estate, positive orders were sent to the Irish Government to
treat him with more consideration, and to give him a commission
as Governor of Ulster with authority quite equal to
that of a President in other provinces. Fitzwilliam was also
told to give out that the expedition was not intended against
the natives, but against the usurping Scots. In practice, of
course, no such distinction was or could be observed. Fitzwilliam
hastened to assure Walsingham, who had just become
Secretary of State, that the rumour of his opposition to Essex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
was mere slander, and that he would embrace his enterprise
heartily.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Queen will
not make
Essex Lord
Deputy.</div>

<p>The English Ministry saw clearly enough that nothing
could be made of the Ulster expedition without great expense.
This the Queen was most unwilling to incur, and some
proposed to make Essex Lord Deputy as the easiest way out
of the difficulty. He was, they said, &#8216;painful in watch, in
travail, in wet and dry, in hunger and cold, and frank of his
own purse in her Majesty&#8217;s service.&#8217; The Queen&#8217;s honour
would be saved by withdrawing in this way from a hopeless
enterprise, and the Earl&#8217;s feelings would be spared by promoting
instead of recalling him. But Elizabeth refused
positively to make anyone Deputy who had a landed estate
in Ireland, and the reason was good whether suggested by
Leicester or not. Sir F. Knollys feared that if the Queen
would neither make the Earl Deputy, nor take the enterprise
into her own hands, the unlucky adventurer would be undone,
to her Majesty&#8217;s great danger and dishonour. Lady
Essex&#8217;s father might have been well pleased to have her living
in Dublin, but if Leicester, as is exceedingly probable, was
already her lover, opposition would not be wanting. &#8216;Yet all
men,&#8217; says Knollys significantly, &#8216;outwardly do seem to favour
my Lord Essex and his enterprise.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Essex is
made
Governor of
Ulster,</div>

<p>Essex became Governor of Ulster, and in less than a
month longed to be rid of an office which he could not fill
with credit. He was very willing to be Lord Deputy, for that
might give him the means of reducing Ulster, but he feared
that no Deputy would ever brook a separate governor for the
Northern province.</p>

<div class="sidenote">but can do
nothing.</div>

<p>Having planned an expedition against Tirlogh Luineach,
he applied to Fitzwilliam for help, and the Deputy, willing to
show his goodwill, called upon the gentlemen of the Pale.
But, with the single exception of Lord Slane, they refused
to go. Even the Louth people, who were on the borders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Ulster, would do nothing but complain that they were overtaxed;
&#8216;and they think,&#8217; said Essex sarcastically, &#8216;to have
greater thanks for denial to go with me, than for their forwardness
in this service; they do so often and so openly
exclaim and complain unto me, and I not able to redress it,
as I am truly weary of myself.&#8217; The treatment which the
regular troops received was not such as to make the service
popular. Fitzwilliam, or some of those about him, tried to
husband the scanty resources of the Irish Government by
giving the victualler a hint that he need not exert himself too
much in Ulster. The garrisons of Dundalk and Newry were
consequently neglected, and universal desertion was only prevented
by the timely arrival of fifty barrels of herrings which
one of the Earl&#8217;s servants had bought at Carlingford. &#8216;For
twenty days,&#8217; wrote the sorely tried Governor, &#8216;they had
neither bread, drink, fish, nor flesh, but were forced to beg,
and lay their arms, pieces, and garments in gage for to buy
them food.&#8217; The 300 men last sent over had been willingly
diverted to Ulster by the Lord Deputy, who wanted the means
to feed them, and there was &#8216;no provision made for these men,
neither yet for 80 horsemen and 260 footmen, and the
victualler hath unto them delivered but only 30<i>l.</i> to make
provision for these 600 and odd men; ... and the soldiers
because they, in their extremity, received those herrings from
me, do think that the charge of their victualling is mine, and
do lay the blame of their wants upon me, and do all fall to
mutiny, and say that unless I will see that they shall be
better victualled, they will do neither any service, nor yet
abide there.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Essex will
not despair.</div>

<p>&#8216;For my part,&#8217; said Essex, with a noble obstinacy, &#8216;I will
not leave the enterprise as long as I have any foot of land in
England unsold. But my land is so entangled to the Queen&#8217;s
Majesty, for that money which I had of her towards this
journey, as I cannot sell any land that I have for the one-half
of that which before I might have done.&#8217; He was in the
position of a borrower driving a risky trade, or of a would-be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
insurer who leads an unhealthy life. No one was willing to
lend or to buy where the Queen was first mortgagee. He
proposed two courses to her Majesty. If she would bear the
charge of 100 horse and 600 foot, while he furnished 100
horse, and made a last effort with the adventurers, then he
engaged to make the North profitable to the Crown, either by
rents from the natives or by English settlers. &#8216;Let me bear
both the blame and the shame if I do not before Christmas
Day make that part as quiet as any part in Ireland shall be.&#8217;
For himself he asked only a grant at a nominal rent of
Island Magee, the long narrow peninsula which protects
Lough Larne from the fury of the Northern Sea, on condition
of contributing 500<i>l.</i> towards any town which the Queen
might think proper to build there. &#8216;I find it more easier to
bear the charges of 200 men than to bear the name of a general
without wages.&#8217; The other alternative was for the Queen to
take 250<i>l.</i> a year in land in discharge of the 10,000<i>l.</i> which he
owed her, and to free the third part of his estate from the
claim of the Crown. He would then do his best to carry out
the original scheme alone, &#8216;but yet this way will neither please
the adventurers, nor encourage them to go forwards.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
resolves to
recall
Essex.</div>

<p>The Queen had resolved to recall Essex as soon as he had
&#8216;lapped up&#8217; all matters with Tirlogh Luineach and Sir Brian
upon the most decent terms possible, and to limit her efforts
in Ulster to keeping a small garrison at Carrickfergus, and
to wheedling a small tribute out of the chiefs. But after
reading the letter last quoted she changed her mind. Her
heart was touched, and she resolved to give another chance to
a subject whose loyalty no neglect could impair, and whose
constancy no failure could overcome. In one of those letters
which go far to explain her wonderful power, she thanked
him heartily for his services, unsuccessful as they had hitherto
been, &#8216;acknowledging the same to have been grounded not
upon gain, but upon honour, an argument of true nobility,
and we cannot, whatsoever issue the same hath had, but make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
account of you as of that noble man who, in respect of other
service, hath rather chosen to suffer any intolerable toil in
Ireland than yield to enjoy the delicacy of England. Which
rare affection, if we should not cherish, we should show ourselves
unworthy of so rare a servant.&#8217; He had complained
that his letters were not answered; she reminded him that
they contained matters not fit for every secretary, &#8216;to which
our eyes and the fire only have been made privy.&#8217; She accepted
his surrender of Clandeboye, and agreed for a time
to maintain the required force, and she promised to grant him
Island Magee. The Lord Deputy should resume the government,
receiving at the same time strict and secret instructions
to co-operate with him in his attempt to expel the Scots
and to reduce Sir Brian MacPhelim.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Essex
powerless.</div>

<p>But royal words, however sweet, could not conquer Ulster.
Heroic as was his character in many ways, Essex had not the
gifts which have been given to a few great generals. He
could not infuse courage or endurance into wretched starvelings,
nor had he administrative genius to conquer the
shortcomings of his commissariat. Newry and Dundalk must
have been evacuated but for a timely supply of herrings.
The peculation was such that stores calculated to last six
months did not last four, and that the full supplies for near
600 men were expended on much less than half the number.
The powder was one-quarter coal dust, and was not worth
firing. The Carrickfergus garrison was reduced nearly two-thirds
by desertion and disease, and was so completely
isolated that a traveller going to Dublin might consider 100
horse but a scanty escort. The filth of the town was such as
to make fever almost universal. The services of religion
were neglected, for the &#8216;belly-fed ministers&#8217; who were induced
to visit Ulster liked the danger and hard fare no better
than the gentlemen adventurers whose service had consisted
in eating without paying. The reinforcements sent were of
such quality as to be worse than useless: 100 were raw
recruits from Oxfordshire and Berkshire; 200 were from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Cheshire and Lancashire, and so bad&mdash;the Lancashire men
especially&mdash;as to be scarce fit for field labour. As labourers
Essex had to keep them, &#8216;for soldiers,&#8217; he said, &#8216;they will
never be.&#8217; One hundred veterans promised from Berwick had
been countermanded on a rumour of Desmond&#8217;s submission.
Captain Morris, who had the leading of the ragged regiment,
was destined to lay his bones in Ireland. The fact was that
Carrickfergus had such a bad name in England that everyone
who possibly could avoided service there. Waterhouse, who
was at Chester in constant communication with Ireland,
begged that the men might be sent to Carlingford; but
routine seems to have been too strong for him, and they were
despatched to the old pest-house. The wretched lads died
like flies at the rate of fifteen or twenty a day&mdash;300 were
sick at once, and none could hope to escape. Scarcely a man
was fit even for sentry duty. Essex lay among his men,
and there was not a night but one, two, or three died within
ten feet of him. The remonstrances of his officers against
this heroic foolhardiness prevailed at last, and he was induced
to withdraw the remains of the garrison. Out of some 600
only 200, more dead than alive, reached the Pale, where he
had to support them at his own expense.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">He still
has hope.</div>

<p>The Queen&#8217;s gracious letter caused hope to spring once
more in the Earl&#8217;s breast, and with such men as he could
muster he resolved to chastise Sir Brian MacPhelim. That
chief was proclaimed traitor, and 200<i>l.</i> was put upon his
head. At first he despised such threats, and some skirmishing
took place. Having the worst in these encounters, and
perhaps hearing exaggerated accounts of the reinforcement,
Sir Brian thought it prudent to submit. Some thought that
this was done only to gain time until the provisions were
exhausted; but it is probable that Sir Brian looked upon war
against the Queen&#8217;s Governor as different from war against
the Earl of Essex in his capacity of private adventurer. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
far as humility of language went, nothing could be said
against him. He acknowledged that after many years&#8217; loyal
service he had wandered into the wilderness like a blind
beast without knowledge of good. By the good grace of
Almighty God he had been called home, and his chief desire
now was to see her Majesty&#8217;s face. Clandeboye was the
Queen&#8217;s, and he was ready to pay a rent of 1,500 kine for
the first year and to increase it afterwards. At his earnest
request Essex interceded for his pardon, and was sanguine
enough to express an opinion that it would be well
deserved.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lord
Deputy&#8217;s
troubles.</div>

<p>It seems that Burghley wished to make Essex Deputy,
but the Earl, though he was accused of intriguing for it,
had no wish to incur hatred and envy &#8216;in that unfortunate
office.&#8217; &#8216;Who shall serve the Queen and his country faithfully,&#8217;
he said with an evident side glance at Fitzwilliam,
&#8216;shall have his fair reward for his travail; but if he will
respect his gain more than his prince, country, or honesty,
then may he make his gain unmerciful.&#8217; He was quite ready
to serve under Sidney or any other settled Governor, &#8216;and
such a one as is fit for Ireland, not Ireland for him.... All
the ill-disposed now rob and steal, hoping that the new
Governor will pardon all done before his time.... This
people wax proud; yea, the best might be amended; all need
correction.&#8217; The actual Deputy declared that he &#8216;fretted
away his life in misery.&#8217; Not only was he persistently and,
according to himself, quite unjustly accused of trying to
thwart the Ulster enterprise, but he found his credit everywhere
depreciated. Edward Fitzgerald, who may be supposed
to have been tolerably impartial, declared that he
pitied his sad state. The evil feared him but a little. The
Pale bore him no goodwill. The soldiers misliked him,
while the captains complained; and the councillors cynically
abstained from giving advice whenever he seemed inclined to
do anything unpopular or capable of misrepresentation. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
accused his old antagonist Vice-Treasurer Fitton of annoying
him in every possible way, withholding his pay, disputing
his requisitions, and refusing to follow him into the field.</p>

<p>&#8216;I would,&#8217; said Fitzwilliam with evident sincerity, &#8216;abide
the pricking out of my eye or the stitching up of my lip,&#8217;
rather than let private feeling hinder public service; but he
confessed that he could not help disliking a man who counterworked
God&#8217;s will by prejudicing the English Government
against his official superior, with no higher object than to
gratify his own malicious vanity. Fitton was evidently a
provoking person, but he solemnly declared he never gave
Fitzwilliam a crabbed word, whereas the Lord Deputy&#8217;s
household was a hotbed of slander against him. Such,
according to his own account, was the Vice-Treasurer&#8217;s
conscious innocence that he magnanimously signed State
papers which contained covert attacks upon his official conduct.
The poor Deputy could only testify against Fitton&#8217;s
vain-glorious humour, and beg to be recalled from his
&#8216;tabering.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzwilliam
is blamed
for doing
nothing,
but is not

<p>Had Fitzwilliam felt sure of his sovereign&#8217;s favour he
might have laughed at his enemies, and even at his daughter&#8217;s
unwedded condition. But the Queen blamed him roundly
for staying lazily in Dublin, while Desmond lorded it in
Munster and Essex struggled on unsupported in Ulster, and
while Connaught scarcely preserved the semblance of the
royal dominion. Fitzwilliam pleaded with perfect truth that
to take the field without proper forces would be to risk her
Majesty&#8217;s honour. His credit was at the lowest ebb. The
commissariat was in a state of chaos, and though he had often
and urgently asked for a victualler none was sent&mdash;&#8216;a most
necessary minister, the toilsome care of whose charge doth
trouble me more than half the Government besides.&#8217; To save
appearances he gave out that he expected his recall daily.
&#8216;Between these changes,&#8217; said Essex, in words that apply
now as well as then, &#8216;is ever all the mischief in Ireland; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
therefore it were good to make it surely known that he shall
still remain, or else to send such a Governor as you do determine
on presently, for the expectation of a change maketh
this man not to be obeyed nor cared for.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fears for
the peace of
Munster.</div>

<p>The mission of Edward Fitzgerald in Munster having had
no very favourable result, the Queen rebuked Fitzwilliam
sharply for giving him orders, contrary to her instructions, &#8216;to
deal and negotiate with the Earl of Desmond as sent from
us, whereas contrariwise our meaning was that he privately,
as a kinsman, should have repaired unto him by your
license, not by our direction; ... for as the matter is now
handled, we think ourselves touched in honour, for that the
Earl may have cause to think that we should now seek upon
him&mdash;a thing very unfitting for the place and quality we
hold.&#8217; The harassed Deputy, who had himself the worst
opinions of Desmond&#8217;s intentions, lamented his hard fate,
and sent Sir James Dowdall, Second Justice of the Queen&#8217;s
Bench, to remind the Earl that there was a government
in Ireland. He had no force to coerce, though the Queen
taunted him with his indolence, and there were constant
rumours of invasion, requiring in his opinion the presence
of men of war on the coasts of Cork and Kerry. Dowdall&#8217;s
letters remained long unanswered, and he lay idly at Clonmel
listening to reports which he knew were too vague to
be worth forwarding. Justice Walshe, in whose single person
the government or non-government of Munster for the
moment centred, furnished Burghley with a long list of
Desmond&#8217;s misdeeds. He had spoiled the Sheriff of Limerick
and threatened to cut his tongue out for complaining. All
sorts flocked to him, finding it easier and cheaper to rob than
to work and be robbed. Desmond gave out that there should
be no law but Brehon law between Geraldines. James Fitzmaurice
was moving very suspiciously, and had been accepted
as chief by the Ryans of Owney, a wild country bordering on
the Shannon. The MacSheeheys, or Desmond gallowglasses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
had taken the Mayor of Limerick and kept him in pawn
for one of their number who was the Queen&#8217;s hostage.
But the most daring act of all was the apprehension of
Captain Bourchier, who was attacked on the high-road
near Kilmallock, and driven into a castle belonging to the
Sheriff of Limerick. James Fitzmaurice hurried to the spot
with a strong force, took him out, and gave him in custody
to a personal enemy, Edmund Fitzdavy, who treated him so
cruelly that he was ready to put an end to himself.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>Desmond had guns taken at Castlemaine, and it was
feared that neither Cork, Galway, nor Kinsale were safe.
The chiefs were supposed to have decided that if a President
came each would overthrow his own castle and take to the
field. Five hundred ladders and a quantity of sapping tools
had been collected within easy reach of Kilmallock. Stukeley
and Archbishop Fitzgibbon were in Brittany consulting with
the leaguers. Catholic intriguers were as busy as ever in
Spain, and a servant in Desmond&#8217;s livery had been seen at
the Spanish Court. Among some thirty English and Irish
Catholics of note who were in Spain about this time were
Stukeley and Fitzgibbon, Rowland Turner, William Walshe,
Papal Bishop of Meath, and Dr. Nicholas Sanders, who was
destined to play a greater part than any of them in Irish
history. Philip lavished great sums upon them, and was
besides said to spend 23,000 ducats a year in Flanders in the

<div class="sidenote">Fitzwilliam
is
almost desperate.</div>

<p>Stung by the Queen&#8217;s taunts, Fitzwilliam determined to
undertake military operations in Munster with such forces
as he could command&mdash;that is, with about 800 men badly
fed and paid. As a last chance of peace he resolved to
consult Essex, who at once came to Dublin, whence he despatched
the following letter to Desmond:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Essex and
Desmond.</div>

<p>&#8216;My Lord,&mdash;I understand my cousin, George Bourchier,
in his going to Kilmallock, where his band lay, is by some of
your men taken and hurt stealthily, and most straitly kept in
prison. Sorry I am, my lord, that the gentleman should be
so handled as I hear he is. But truly I am more sorry that
you should give her Majesty cause to conceive so ill with
you as this dealing of yours I fear will give her occasion.
Let me reason, and as I think you have store of ill-counsellors,
who hiss you on to that which is evil, whom daily you
hear and I fear do too much credit unto, so hear, withal, the
advice of those which wish the well-wishing of you, and the
continuance of your house in honour, of which company, I
assure you, I am one. What do you desire, or what is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
mark you shoot at? Is it to the enjoyance of your inheritance
and country that you seek? If it is that this may
satisfy you, there is no seeking to put you from it; and if
any contempt or fault of you hath in your own opinion
brought it in question, her Majesty, as hath been written to
you from thence, is content to pardon you. What should
move you, then, to seek war, when in peace and with honour
you may enjoy all that is your right? If you have in your
head to catch at a further matter, think it is the very highway
to make you with dishonour to lose that which with
honour in true serving of their Prince your ancestors have
gotten and long enjoyed. My lord, consider well of this, and
look into the case deeply and give care unto the sound and
faithful counsel of your friends, and stop the ears from hearkening
unto them which seek by their wicked counsel to
destroy yourself and to overthrow your house. Let not the
enemies have the occasion to triumph at your decay, refuse
not her Majesty&#8217;s favour when she is content to grant it to
you, lest you seek it when it will be denied. Surely in my
opinion her Majesty had rather to erect many such houses as
yours is, than to be the overthrow of yours, although it be
through your own default and folly. And to procure this
her Majesty hath offered as much of her clemency to you, as
with honour she might do to her subjects. I have shortly
showed you my opinion of your case, and given my best
advice, I pray you follow it. I will conclude with my
earnest request to your lordship for the delivery of my cousin
George Bourchier. So wishing that you follow good counsellors
and not flatter yourself with the opinion of your force,
which to contend with her Majesty is nothing, I end and
commit your lordship to God.&#8217;</p>

<p>Five days later he wrote again in the same strain, and
soon afterwards told Burghley that it was very hard that the
Deputy should have precise orders to make war without
being furnished with means. This does not look like intriguing
for the viceroyalty, of which Fitzwilliam evidently
suspected him. In consequence of what he heard from
Desmond, Essex declared himself willing to try his hand at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
&#8216;deciphering&#8217; him, and, at the request of the whole Council,
started with that object; Fitzwilliam privately sneering at
his tardy offers of service. Desmond appointed Kilmacthomas
in the County of Waterford as the place of meeting,
and professed perfect confidence in the Earl and readiness
to be guided by him.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Meeting of
Essex and
Desmond.</div>

<p>On his arrival at Waterford on the eve of the appointed
day, Essex received a message from Desmond to say that he
was at Kilmacthomas. That place being considered rather
remote, Desmond, accompanied by Fitzmaurice and about
sixty horse, advanced to a bridge three miles from the city,
where he was met by Kildare, who brought him to a heath
just outside the walls. After some parley Essex handed him
a protection under the Great Seal for himself and all his
followers for twenty days. Having delivered the paper to
one of his men, he then rode into the town, where the
Countess soon afterwards joined him. At a private conference,
at which only the three Earls and Lady Desmond were
present, he said &#8216;that he would do anything that could be
required of any nobleman in England or Ireland.&#8217; Essex
was satisfied with this, and within three days Desmond went
to Dublin with only four or five attendants, having first
given orders for Captain Bourchier&#8217;s release.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond is
obstinate.</div>

<p>Oddly enough, if she wished him to succeed, the Queen
had not done Essex the honour of having him made a member
of the Irish Council, and he had no part in the abortive negotiations
which followed. Being called upon to perform the
articles concluded in England, Desmond said that he would
take no advantage of these having been extorted from him
under restraint, and that he was willing to be bound, but
only as part of a general settlement. Otherwise he would
be the one unarmed man in Leinster, Munster, and Connaught;
and with all his loyalty he had no mind to be the
common sport and prey of the three provinces. Being asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
to restore the castles which were in the Queen&#8217;s hands before
his escape, and to give up any others when required, he refused
to hold his all at her Majesty&#8217;s pleasure, and could not
believe that she herself desired it. Pardon he was ready to
receive thankfully, but would not &#8216;repair into England to be
a spectacle of poverty to all the world,&#8217; and he asked the
Council to pity his long misery there. He was ready to perform
presently all his promises, but would not give pledges
beyond what he had before agreed to. His only son was in
England, so was Sir James, one of his two legitimate brothers.
&#8216;If neither my son, being mine only son, nor my brother,
whom I love, nor the possession of mine inheritance, as
before is granted, can suffice, then to the justice of God and
the Queen I appeal upon you all.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Meeting of
Essex,
Desmond,
Ormonde,
and
Kildare.</div>

<p>Desmond&#8217;s answers were not considered satisfactory, and
he refused to remain on protection either with Kildare or
Essex till the Queen&#8217;s pleasure should be known. A proclamation
was prepared declaring him a traitor, and offering
500<i>l.</i> for his head, and 1,000<i>l.</i> and a pension to any who
would bring him in alive.</p>

<p>&#8216;In my judgment,&#8217; said Essex, &#8216;the war is unseasonably
begun, because the rest of the realm standeth in so ill terms,
and the manner of Desmond&#8217;s answer might with honour
have suffered a toleration till Ulster had been fully established....
The mischief is without remedy, for I am bound
with the Earl of Kildare, by our words and honours, to safe
conduct Desmond to the confines of Munster, which will take
ten days at least, in which mean the bruit of the war will be
public in all places.... I can hope for none other than a
general stir in all parts at once.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ormonde&#8217;s
advice.</div>

<p>They set out accordingly and met Ormonde at Kilkenny,
whence the four Earls travelled southward together for some
miles; Ormonde riding by the side of his ancient enemy,
and telling him that he was rushing to destruction. No
apparent impression was made; Desmond making no secret
of his plan, which was to defend a few castles and raze the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
others, and to keep the bulk of his force in the field till the
arrival of foreign aid. Lords Gormanston and Delvin refused
to sign the proclamation of treason, which no doubt would not
be popular in Ireland. They relied entirely on the technical
ground that they were not members of the Council; but the
plea was not accepted in England, and they were obliged to
make some sort of excuse.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir William
Drury
sent to help
Fitzwilliam.</div>

<p>Just at the time when Essex was undertaking to &#8216;decipher&#8217;
Desmond, the Queen wrote one of those stinging despatches
which terrified men more than her father&#8217;s axe or her sister&#8217;s
faggots. She accused the Lord Deputy and Council of want
of judgment, and of truckling to a rebel while such a faithful
subject as Captain Bourchier was severely imprisoned, and
other faithful subjects were sorely oppressed. They should
have proclaimed Desmond traitor and proceeded against him
without delay; her honour was touched, and there were as
many troops as &#8216;have sufficed for others that have supplied
your place to have prosecuted like rebels of greater strength
and force than we perceive he is of.&#8217; Since Perrott&#8217;s departure
Fitzwilliam had frequently complained of the want of a high
military officer in whom he could confide. Such &#8216;an express
gentleman,&#8217; as the Queen designated him, was now sent in the
person of Sir William Drury.</p>

<p>Fitzwilliam was to consult him in all martial affairs, and
to place him in such authority as befitted so gallant a soldier
and so experienced a servant. Five days later the Privy
Council warned Fitzwilliam that if he once entered Munster
he would be bound in honour to exact an unconditional
submission from Desmond, but that he would do well to wink
at the misdeeds of smaller offenders, provided they yielded
themselves by a fixed day. There were troops enough ready
in the West of England to come to the rescue should an invasion
of Ireland really take place.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>With Ormonde&#8217;s warning voice still in his ears, the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>fatuated
Geraldine chief called together certain of his followers
and asked their advice. The result was a document, afterwards
famous as Desmond&#8217;s &#8216;Combination,&#8217; in which some
twenty gentlemen declared that he had done all that could
be fairly required of him, and advised him not to yield to the
last articles, nor to give hostages, even if the Lord Deputy
should assert his authority by force of arms. &#8216;We, the
persons underwritten,&#8217; the paper concludes, &#8216;do advise and
counsel the said Earl to defend himself from the violence of
the said Lord Deputy.... We renounce God if we do spare
life, lands, and goods ... to maintain and defend this our
advice against the Lord Deputy or any other that will covet
the said Earl&#8217;s inheritance.&#8217; Desmond&#8217;s brother John was one
of the signataries, but James Fitzmaurice&#8217;s name is absent.
It was in contemplation at this time to buy them both off with
some portion of the Earl&#8217;s lands.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Campaign
in Munster.
Derrinlaur
Castle.</div>

<p>Letter after letter came from the Queen upbraiding her
representative&#8217;s inaction, and Fitzwilliam at last fixed a day
for beginning a campaign, though he had no money and was
in want of everything. Then there was another postponement,
and Ormonde undertook to negotiate in the meantime,
Desmond fencing a good deal and avoiding a direct answer.
Matters were brought to a crisis by attacking Derrinlaur, a
castle on the Suir, which belonged to Sir Thomas Butler of
Cahir, and which had been treacherously taken some months
before by Rory MacCragh, one of Desmond&#8217;s most notorious
partisans. It interrupted the traffic between Clonmel and
Waterford. Fitzwilliam and Ormonde took three or four
days to run a mine under the walls, and were almost ready
to spring it when the garrison, after the manner of Irish
garrisons, tried to escape. They were intercepted, and all
killed. This tragedy had an immediate effect on Desmond,
who saw that he could not hope to hold any fortress against
the Government, and he came to Clonmel and made a humble
submission, which was repeated at Cork after service in the
cathedral, in the presence of the Munster nobility. Castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>maine
was surrendered to Captain Apsley, as well as the castles
in Kenry, which had been the chief matter in dispute, and it
was agreed that there should be oblivion as to other causes
of difference. That Desmond only yielded to superior force,
and did not abandon his designs, may be inferred from what
he did as soon as the Deputy&#8217;s back was turned. He made
over all his lands in Ireland to Lord Dunboyne, Lord Power,
and John FitzEdmond FitzGerald of Cloyne, in trust for
himself and his wife during their joint lives, with provision
for his daughters, and final remainder to his son. The
object no doubt was to preserve the property in case of unsuccessful
rebellion, but against a victorious sovereign such
paper defences were ever in vain. Two days later both Lord
and Lady Desmond wrote to the Queen in very humble strain,
the former praying for one drop of grace to assuage the flame
of his tormented mind.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Essex and
Tirlogh
Luineach
O&#8217;Neill.</div>

<p>Finding Desmond unlikely to give immediate trouble,
the Queen thought she saw her way to helping Essex without
increasing her expenses. 26,000<i>l.</i> a year and 2,000 men
was what he asked for, and to show that the project was not
hopeless he determined to attempt some immediate service.
Drawing the bulk of his forces out of Clandeboye to Newry
and Dundalk, he began operations by attacking an island
near Banbridge, whence three of Tirlogh Brasselagh O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s
sons plundered Magennis and the Baron of Dungannon.
Phelim O&#8217;Neill and his cousin were taken, and all the band
killed except five or six who escaped by swimming. Essex
then went to Dublin, consulted the Council, and summoned
Tirlogh Luineach to meet him near Benburb, on the Blackwater.
But in spite of every promise of safe-conduct,
Tirlogh refused to come to any point where the river was
fordable, and Tyrone was accordingly invaded. There had
been a bountiful harvest, and the corn-stacks were burned
from Benburb to Clogher. Here Essex halted and sent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
party into Fermanagh, who drove off 400 cows and thus
secured Maguire&#8217;s neutrality. Tirlogh Luineach, with 200
horse and 600 Scots, attempted a night attack on the camp,
but this failed, and the Earl continued his march to Lifford,
burning and spoiling, but seeing no enemy. At Strabane
O&#8217;Donnell made his appearance with 200 horse and 500
gallowglasses, and Con O&#8217;Donnell, who held Lifford Castle in
spite of him, also crossed into Tyrone. Provision ships lay
at a point half way between Lifford and Derry, and while
the victualling proceeded Essex explained the political
situation to O&#8217;Donnell, O&#8217;Dogherty, and other chief men of
Tyrconnel. O&#8217;Donnell, who saw an opportunity of regaining
Lifford Castle, and those who depended on him declared
themselves ready to do all that the Governor wished; but
Con, who had married Tirlogh Luineach&#8217;s daughter, said
bluntly and very truly &#8216;that it was a dangerous matter to
enter into war, and that for his own part he would know
how he should be maintained before he should work himself
trouble for any respect.&#8217; He added &#8216;that he had rather live
as a felon or a rebel than adventure his undoing for the
Queen.&#8217; Lifford Castle was accordingly taken and handed
over to O&#8217;Donnell, materials for coining being found in it.
Con was arrested, escaped, was re-captured, and sent a
prisoner to Dublin. The Irish annalists say that this arrest
was treacherous, but it does not appear that he had any safe-conduct.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Earl
can do
nothing of
moment
against the
O&#8217;Neills.</div>

<p>Before leaving Lifford Essex commissioned O&#8217;Donnell to
seize upon all O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s cattle which had crossed the Foyle to
be under Con&#8217;s protection, but under no circumstances to
allow his nephew&#8217;s own herds to be touched. The O&#8217;Donnells
disregarded the latter injunction, but &#8216;laid hold on them, and,
as their manner is, every man carried his booty home;&#8217; 1,400
head only out of a much larger number being brought into
the English camp. In consideration of what his followers
had gained, Essex bound the chief to have an extra force of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
600 men, and swore him to fight with Tirlogh Luineach as
long as her Majesty did. On his road home he carefully
burned all O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s corn, and boasted that the value was not
less than 5,000<i>l.</i>&mdash;a mode of making war which was certainly
not calculated to advance the civilisation of Ulster. Tirlogh&#8217;s
strength was practically unbroken, and it is evident that few
thought Essex capable of doing anything great. He had, he
complained, in all his journeys to the North had no help
from the Pale but fifteen pack-horses on one occasion and
seven on another. Provisions were never given &#8216;but at such
extreme pennyworths as hath not been heard of in this
country.&#8217; To his sanguine mind it still seemed easy, if the
Lord Deputy would only co-operate cordially, &#8216;to establish
the country as it may be ever preserved from rebellion hereafter.&#8217;
Fitzwilliam, who had no illusions left, thought
differently, and there can be little doubt that he was right.
The Earl himself had privately told Burghley that the Queen
was nothing benefited by former pacifications of the North,
and that only a permanent garrison could make permanent
work. There was little hope of revenue. Every captain in
Ulster was, he thought, ready to take an estate of inheritance
and give up Irish customs. Many said they had offered as
much and had been refused; &#8216;and yet they allege, that they
have ever paid more than would maintain a good garrison,
which hath been put in some of their purses which governed
here.&#8217; The Crown was in fact too poor to pay its servants,
and so they paid themselves. Under such circumstances it
is not surprising that expeditions into Ulster were like the
fortresses which children build upon the beach: the unresisting
sand is easily moulded, the architect&#8217;s pride is
great, but the next flood washes all the work away.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Essex is
summoned
to Court.</div>

<p>The Queen, who seems to have had a certain admiration
for Essex, was pleased with his last service, and inclined to
favour his plans for the permanent plantation of the North.
But her council, as she was careful to point out, required
more information. Did he propose that the colonists in
Clandeboye and between the Blackwater and the Pale should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
be English or Irish, or a mixture of both? Were his towns
to be walled with stone or earth, or with a mixture of both?
Had Maguire, Magennis, and MacMahon agreed to contribute
towards the maintenance of 100 horse and 200 foot? What
arrangements could be made for provisions, for maintaining
garrisons, for labour and material? To resolve these doubts,
which came rather late in the day, Essex was summoned to
appear at Court as soon as he could leave his post. The
choice being left to him, he decided not to go, and expressed
an opinion that the conditional order came &#8216;either of her
Majesty&#8217;s misliking of the cause, or of me as unable to
execute the thing, and so make stay of me there, either by
disallowing the work as not feasible, or else to essay as the
honour of it should be reaped by another.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">ADMINISTRATION OF FITZWILLIAM, 1574 AND 1575, AND
REAPPOINTMENT OF SIDNEY.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Unjustifiable
seizure
of Sir Brian
MacPhelim,
who is
executed.</div>

<p>If violence were vigour and a readiness to act on rumour decision,
then the next exploit of Essex would entitle him to a
high place among the leaders of men. There is no difficulty
in believing that Sir Brian MacPhelim had been plotting with
Tirlogh Luineach and other enemies of English rule, and it
is quite possible that he or his followers had committed some
barbarous outrages. He had all along been hostile to the
Earl&#8217;s enterprise, and it is not surprising that he should have
sought to frustrate it. But he came to meet Essex at Belfast
in friendly guise, and he brought his wife and other relations
with him. It is plain from this that he intended no immediate
treachery, but Essex, who was getting soured, could
only see evidence of dissimulation. He proposed to arrest
his visitors, and his officers made no opposition. The
O&#8217;Neills defended their chief, and much blood was shed. &#8216;I
have,&#8217; Essex wrote to the Privy Council, &#8216;apprehended Sir
Brian, his half-brother Rory Oge MacQuillin, Brian&#8217;s wife,
and certain of the principal persons, and put others to the
sword, to the number of 200 in all places, whereof 40 of his
best horsemen.&#8217; Sir Brian, his wife, and other prisoners were
sent to Dublin, and Essex announced that they would be tried
according to law. It is only certain that they were executed.
There was, be it observed, no state of war between O&#8217;Neill
and the Earl. The chieftain was not a proclaimed traitor,
and there was no warrant against him. And even if it be
granted that he was technically guilty of treason, could his
wife be considered equally guilty? The Earl&#8217;s own account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
does not justify him, while the Irish annalists charge him
with the blackest treachery. &#8216;Peace, sociality, and friendship,&#8217;
say the &#8216;Four Masters,&#8217; &#8216;were established between Brian,
the son of Phelim Bacagh O&#8217;Neill, and the Earl of Essex;
and a feast was afterwards prepared by Brian, to which the
Earl and the chiefs of his people were invited; and they
passed three nights and days together pleasantly and cheerfully.
At the expiration of this time, as they were agreeably
drinking and making merry, Brian, his brother, and his wife,
were seized upon by the Earl, and all his people put unsparingly
to the sword&mdash;men, women, youths, and maidens&mdash;in
Brian&#8217;s own presence. Brian was afterwards sent to Dublin,
together with his wife and brother, where they were cut in
quarters. Such was the end of their feast. This unexpected
massacre, this wicked and treacherous murder of the lord of
the race of Hugh Boy O&#8217;Neill, the head and the senior of the
race of Owen, son of Nial of the Nine Hostages, and of all the
Gaels, a few only excepted, was a sufficient cause of hatred
and disgust of the English to the Irish.&#8217; Some praised the
Earl&#8217;s conduct, and there seems to have been no official blame,
but Ormonde hinted his dislike of what had been done.
Essex meant well, he said, God send it so: &#8216;I am loth to
speak of the North, which has cost her Majesty much, but I
pray God a worse come not in Sir Brian&#8217;s place.&#8217; The Earl
himself boasted &#8216;that this little execution hath broken the
faction and made them all afeard;&#8217; and that two of Sir Brian&#8217;s
kinsmen were competitors for his inheritance, and had applied
to Captain Norris, each offering to live in peace. The knight-errant
who had started with visions of creating an Eden in
Ulster, now thought it a triumph to make men of two minds
in an house.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Vacillation
of the
Queen.</div>

<p>Essex believed that 2,000 soldiers would suffice for Ireland,
1,300 of them being stationed in Ulster while permanent
fortified posts were being built and garrisoned, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
that when the building was done 500 men would easily hold
the province. To this arrangement the Queen, with much
hesitation, agreed. Garrisons cost money, as she knew by
the experience of Maryborough and Philipstown, and like
them they might after all be but very moderately successful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Essex and
Fitzwilliam.</div>

<p>As soon as Fitzwilliam knew that he was expected to represent
the Crown and to furnish all garrisons in the three
southern provinces with 700 men, he at once declined the
task. The force actually in Ireland was about 3,000, and in
case of the proposed scheme not taking effect, it was to be
reduced by one half. All was made dependent on perfect
accord between the Deputy and the Governor of Ulster; and
in fact they had never been on really cordial terms. Nor did
Elizabeth herself speak with any confidence, and it is plain
that personal regard and admiration for Essex were struggling
in her mind with the desire to throw away no more money
upon Ulster. It was in Elizabeth&#8217;s nature to vacillate, and the
tendency may have been increased by Burghley&#8217;s illness. To
keep Essex in Ireland, and at the same time to secure his
failure there, may have been Leicester&#8217;s policy. That some
sinister influence was at work may be inferred from the Earl&#8217;s
complaint to Burghley that many letters sent to him were
intercepted, and that he could trust no messenger but his own
servants. Fitzwilliam&#8217;s refusal to incur the responsibility of
government without proper forces was reasonable enough, but
his manner of proceeding shows how deep his feeling against
Essex really was. He summarily discharged all men above
2,000; and the Earl, as he himself expressed it, &#8216;having no
longer soldiers to govern,&#8217; resigned the government of Ulster.
&#8216;Being now,&#8217; he said, &#8216;altogether private, I do desire your
Majesty&#8217;s good license so to live in a corner of Ulster, which
I hire for my money; where though I may seem to pass
my time somewhat obscurely, a life, my case considered,
fittest for me, yet shall not be without some stay in these
parts, and comfort to such as hoped to be rid from the tyranny
of the rebels.&#8217; In the meantime his men were unpaid and
unfed; for the Vice-Treasurer had orders from the Deputy to
give them nothing without the Queen&#8217;s special directions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the victualler feared that he might not have sufficient warrant.
Essex, who complained bitterly that he had not even ten days&#8217;
notice, appealed to the Council, and both Fitton and Loftus
sided with him; for the prospect of having 1,500 disbanded
soldiers let loose upon the Pale was not a pleasant one. &#8216;To
you,&#8217; Essex told Burghley, &#8216;I am content to be beholden, yet
to be generally bound to all men as I have been in this action,
is to my nature such a misery as I confess all the wretchedness
that I have found in Ireland hath not been comparable to
this. And now, since my good deserts here, if they were any,
be extinguished with dishonour, I pray you let my small sins
be also forgotten. I suffer pain enough. Increase not my
misery with your ill opinion.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Troops
hastily disbanded.</div>

<p>Fitzwilliam, as on some other occasions, showed a lamentable
want of dignity, and, if we are to believe the Governor
of Ulster, he dismissed the troops with indecent haste and
with no more responsible advice than that of his wife. &#8216;My
lady, as I am most credibly informed, kept her Majesty&#8217;s
letters three days and coted every line of it, and in the end
gave her final judgment that I and all my soldiers should be
cassed; and it was no sooner done but here was such a
general joy conceived by some about him, as though some
great victory had been obtained, and indeed it agreed well
with his former report, for not six weeks since he said there
were two Deputies in Ireland, and named me for one, and
added that either he would have all, or I should have all.&#8217;
Tirlogh Luineach, or perhaps his astute wife, knew how to
profit by these dissensions, for no sooner was it known that
Essex had resigned his province, than he thanked Fitzwilliam
for not invading his country unjustly, as the Earl had done.
He professed great readiness to treat with the Lord Deputy.
His loyalty to the Queen only had prevented him from
accusing Essex several times: his only desire was peace, and
he had no wish to injure any person in the English districts.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The Queen
encourages
Essex.</div>

<p>Elizabeth had not bargained for being so promptly taken
at her word. &#8216;We did never,&#8217; she said, &#8216;think that upon
such a sudden either you our Deputy would have refused to
take that your charge with those numbers, or you the Earl
have given over your government of Ulster.&#8217; To the one
she was willing to allow 700 men in addition to garrisons,
hinting at the same time that she had evidently been paying
for imaginary soldiers. To the other she said that the
enterprise was not abandoned, and Maltby was authorised
to use encouraging language. Munitions were sent, and
even some money, and Sir Peter Carew was ordered to
Ulster as a valuable lieutenant, and probably also a pleasant
companion for the Earl. All this was open and official, but
to the Earl she wrote a private letter, which, to one of his
romantic temper, was probably more consoling than a Lord-Lieutenant&#8217;s
commission with unlimited warrant to raise and
pay troops. She could not but feel that he had failed, but
her heart was touched, and she addressed him thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;For your more satisfaction we have thought good to
signify unto you, that by all your actions, your wise behaviour
and constancy in them, your pains and travels sustained
by yourself bodily, the great charge that you have
been at in your private expenses, and consuming of your
revenues and patrimony in our service, and for the attaining
of honour by virtue and travail, we have great cause to think
you a rare treasure of our realm and a principal ornament
of our nobility; we wish daily unto God we had many such;
and are sorry that in anything you should be discouraged....
What success soever your enterprise shall have we must
needs have a great good opinion of you as a thankful prince
ought to have; whereof you may be bold to assure yourself,
and all such your friends as would be glad thereof, which be,
you may be bold, for your rare virtues and noble courage, a
great number.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">He sets out
towards
Tyrone.</div>

<p>In his delight at this letter, and notwithstanding the
doubtful tenour of Maltby&#8217;s instructions, Essex sought a reconciliation
with Fitzwilliam. Both professed to bear no
personal resentment, and to have quarrelled only on public
grounds, but others could see that their animosity was of long
standing and proportionately difficult to appease. The Earl
was sanguine that now at last he was on the high road to
success. &#8216;I would not,&#8217; he confessed, &#8216;blame the Queen if
she were weary of Ireland ... it is certain her Highness has
spent 600,000<i>l.</i> in her time here and the realm never the
better; but, trust me, sir, reformation was never thoroughly
intended until now, as I think.&#8217; Full of hope he set forward
towards the Blackwater, having already employed 600
labourers to cut passes through the woods bordering on
Tyrone, where the people, since his devastating raid in the
previous autumn, had been living altogether on flesh. &#8216;They
have been occupied with raids and incursions this sowing
time, and their next harvest shall be by all likelihood twice
as urgent, and therefore it is certain that they must either
starve or obey very shortly.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
again
changes
her mind.</div>

<p>When Essex started once more for the North, Maltby was
able to say that he and the Deputy were very good friends,
and that the country generally was pretty quiet, &#8216;but for the
ordinary uncertainty of the Irish, <i>quod natura dedit</i>.&#8217; The
Scots had gone home, and Tirlogh Luineach, who saw that
mischief was intended, sent his wife to Newry to sue for
peace. She held out for the old rights of O&#8217;Neill, but offered
to pay a &#8216;tribute,&#8217; in consideration of his superiority over
Maguire and MacMahon being acknowledged by the Crown.
Ten days were given to Tirlogh to consider the matter further,
and Essex withdrew to Drogheda, where he received a letter
from the Queen which put an end to all his hopes. She
allowed that he might well be surprised at this &#8216;sudden
change, but that she had no meaning that he should proceed
in the service, otherwise than we thought it necessary for a
time, in respect of the danger he had laid before her of a
general revolt.&#8217; The political horizon was troubled, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
full consideration she had made up her mind that the Ulster
project could not be made to pay, and must be abandoned.
&#8216;Direct the course of proceeding,&#8217; she said, &#8216;in such sort as
the enterprise may yet be so given over as our honour may best
be salved&#8217; and the quiet of Ireland provided for. How all
this might best be done was referred to the discretion of
Essex, who was to consult the Lord Deputy and Council.
Tirlogh Luineach was to be made, if possible, to relinquish
his claim to the Urraghs, to content himself with the modern
county of Tyrone, and to join in expelling the Scots. A fort
at the Blackwater would be most desirable, if it could be
built cheaply with the help of those who would be protected
by it from O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s tyranny.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Essex
scheme is

Fort at
Blackwater.</div>

<p>Essex bowed loyally to her Majesty&#8217;s will, spoke much of
her good-nature and little of his own disappointment, and
only begged that she would have some regard for his ruined
fortunes. But he gently reproached the Privy Council with
unkindness for not warning him before he spent his substance
and his health &#8216;in an action which, as it now appears, was
never intended to be performed.&#8217; With a heavy heart he set
out for the Blackwater, and began building a fort there.
Tirlogh Luineach, who had 1,900 of his own followers and
1,400 Scots with him, sent to say that he was ready to
make peace and to abjure Sorley Boy and his Scots, if the
building operations were suspended. Essex consenting to a
parley, Tirlogh supposed that he had gained his point, and
insisted on Sorley being a party. &#8216;This storm is over,&#8217;
he said to his Scotch ally, &#8216;and the Earl shall neither build
nor make war.&#8217; Finding that the work went on, he proposed
to attack before the defences should be tenable, but Sorley
refused, saying that good watch was kept at night, and that
he would only fight if Tyrone were invaded. The O&#8217;Neills
had no mind to do all themselves, and Tirlogh, supported
neither by clansmen nor auxiliaries, said that he would trust
the English. Essex crossed the river, cut off 1,200 kine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
drove O&#8217;Neill into the bogs, following him so close that he
had to leave his horse and his mantle behind. A bridge with
stone piers and timber superstructure was finished, earthen
bridge-heads were thrown up, and an entrenched enclosure
constructed to hold 200 men and tenable by fifty; the Baron
of Dungannon agreeing to find victuals for the latter number.
Essex had perhaps no great skill as an engineer; for Sidney
visited the fort four months later and found it &#8216;imperfect, not
worth the charge of the keeping if there be peaceable proceeding;
the bridge and gate to guard it not half reared.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Advice of
Waterhouse.
Profit
<i>versus</i>
honour.</div>

<p>Tirlogh having sued for peace, Essex was now in a position
to make it on such tolerable terms as might &#8216;salve the
Queen&#8217;s honour,&#8217; his principle being to acknowledge none of
the O&#8217;Neill claims, but to wink at their practical assertion.
Tirlogh agreed to confine himself in general to Tyrone, to
give up his claim to superiority over his neighbours, to keep
the peace towards O&#8217;Donnell and other subjects of the Queen,
and to furnish his contingent to all hostings. On the other
hand, he was excused from coming to any governor against
his will, was to have a share in the customs of Lough Foyle,
and might have 300 Scots in pay, provided they belonged to
the Campbell and not to the MacDonnell connection. His
claim to tribute from O&#8217;Dogherty would be acknowledged
whenever he could prove his title. These terms were considered
reasonable by so good a judge as Maltby, but Fitzwilliam
had lately taken the precaution to inform the Queen
that Tirlogh Luineach might easily be dealt with without
any of the fuss which Essex thought proper to make about
the matter. The Deputy had seen so much of Ireland, that
he had ceased to have any very high standard. Waterhouse,
the devoted partisan of Essex, also thought it possible to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
the point of honour, and to avoid war by a composition with the
Irish; but he did not deceive himself about the real nature of
a peace so made. &#8216;All this,&#8217; he said, &#8216;will be but patches,
and (according to your country proverb) "make much work
for the tinker." If this plot which here hath good allowance
and there is thought probable take not place, nor some better
form of reformation devised, then it were good to persuade
that all soldiers were cassed, and leave here in Dublin some bad
justice for a shadow of her Majesty&#8217;s possession: and let all go
as it will to the devil, and never let it suck up the riches of
England to be vainly spent to no purpose. So would it come
to pass that within two or three years there would be twenty
kings, and every one consume other in continual murders,
which tragedy were far better than the remedies that have
been practised here these one hundred years past. You may
take this for a Christmas game, but if profit be preferred before
honour, then there may be somewhat said in this behalf.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">No open
rebellion.</div>

<p>While the English Government played fast and loose
with the Ulster expedition, it was possible to report that no
open rebellion existed in any part of Ireland, and that the
doubtful were, as a rule, bound on pledges. But burning and
spoiling in a small way went on merrily. The high universally
oppressed the low, and &#8216;some were hanged or killed
here and there every day.&#8217; Still, as a rule, it was not necessary
to keep watch, and cattle, at least in the Pale, could
generally be left out at night. Rumours reached Ireland that
Sidney had been finding fault, but Fitzwilliam asserted that
Ireland was in a better state than when the late Lord Deputy
left it.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

defrauded the revenue, and Custom-house officers winked at
their roguery. Victuallers not being sure of payment had
little credit, failed to perform their contracts, and were
tempted into doubtful courses. The courts of law were distrusted,
at least by English residents; one of whom gives the

themselves sufficient to plead at any Bar, and must as the

<div class="sidenote">Kildare is
vehemently
suspected
and arrested.</div>

<p>Desmond was quiet for the time, but the head of the
other great Geraldine family was now suspected in his turn.
In 1574 Kildare had been in great apparent favour with
the Lord Deputy. He had offered Desmond 500<i>l.</i> in ready
money to assume a submissive attitude, and it was thought
that the best way to secure the Pale was to place him in
command on the south and west borders, on condition that
he should discharge his own followers and trust entirely to
100 horse and 300 foot in the Queen&#8217;s pay. Fitzwilliam,
who admitted that he only accepted the Earl&#8217;s service for
want of a better, had soon reason to believe that he had
treasonable or at least dangerous intentions. John Alen,
an hereditary enemy, was the first accuser, and when it
became known that complaints would be listened to, there
was no want of secret information. Some of the accusations
were probably true, others almost certainly false. It is very
likely that Kildare gave secret intelligence to Rory Oge
O&#8217;More, but incredible that he should have plotted with him
the abduction of Lady Fitzwilliam and her family from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Kilmainham. He evidently had frequent communications
with the O&#8217;Tooles and O&#8217;Byrnes, and it was sworn that one of
his messengers offered to lead a party to burn Athy, where the
Government had large stores. The witness objecting that
the Earl would be a loser by this, the other answered, &#8216;It is
the Earl&#8217;s own devise.&#8217; Much evidence, reaching back to
1572, was offered as to Kildare&#8217;s plots to obtain the government
as his ancestors had it, and of outrages committed at
his instance; but no one dared speak openly. Sir Peter
Carew&#8217;s opinion, &#8216;that Earls were dangerous men to be dealt
with,&#8217; was probably generally accepted in Ireland. Suspicions
were soon aroused, and the Queen very properly censured
Fitzwilliam for trusting such matters to a secretary.
His own or the Archbishop&#8217;s hand might have sufficed. To
encourage witnesses it was resolved to arrest Kildare, but
the intention became known beforehand, and all important
documents were made away with. After much hesitation
the duty was assigned to Essex, who had no difficulty in
making the arrest, but had his doubts about its policy.
&#8216;You must,&#8217; he said, &#8216;take heed that you transfer not the
greatness of some to make it trouble in some other, so were
the second error worse than the first.&#8217; Short as was his
confinement in Dublin Castle, Kildare managed to have
interviews there with Edmund Boy, who was one of his chief
accusers, and so worked upon his feelings that he made his
escape. Richard Fitzgerald, another important witness, was
hanged by Feagh MacHugh O&#8217;Byrne. On arriving in London
a few days later, Kildare was placed in seclusion under the
charge of Lord Keeper Bacon; &#8216;his cause,&#8217; said Ormonde, &#8216;will
make the Earl of Desmond a melancholy man.&#8217; The Irish
Government believed that there would be no evidence until
Kildare was fairly in the Tower.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Uncertainties.
Sidney
daily expected.</div>

<p>Fitzwilliam&#8217;s constant prayers for a recall had not been
unheard, but it was difficult to find a successor for him, since
it had been resolved that Essex should not be Lord Deputy.
Sidney had been expected as early as July 1574, but he was
in no hurry to start. Waterhouse had gone from Ulster to
England towards the end of 1573, and had laid before the
Privy Council the requests of Essex, especially as to the necessity
of erecting fortifications and providing properly for
provisioning the troops. &#8216;A lack of good foresight&#8217; in high
quarters was the fault which Waterhouse saw most clearly,
and he complained that it was hard to get attention for the
most necessary business. Statesmen pleaded that they were
too busy with Desmond to mind anything else, &#8216;wherein
they travel so far southward that they have lost sight of the
North Pole.&#8217; Various schemes were discussed. Some were
for leaving Fitzwilliam at his post and giving him for a
time the assistance of a military officer of high rank, who
might pacify the country and then leave it to the Deputy.
Others were for at least three Presidents independent of the
chief Governor; &#8216;to breed a certain virtuous envy in these
monarchs, who should do her Majesty best service.&#8217; Others,
again, were for trusting Irish lords, such as Ormonde and
Kildare, leaving only matters of law and justice to the Lord
Deputy. The prevailing opinion was that there should be Presidents,
and that they should be appointed simultaneously
with the new Deputy. Waterhouse&#8217;s advice being asked, he
said that if Essex were rejected there were but two persons
available, Leicester and Sidney. The former could scarcely
be spared, and he therefore advised the choice of the latter,
whose secretary he had been. Sidney was reluctant and
Elizabeth undecided, and more than a year and a half slipped
by without the change being actually made. &#8216;For God&#8217;s
sake despatch him,&#8217; said Fitzwilliam; &#8216;this uncertainty is a
hell of unquietness to me, and so increases mine infirmities
of shoulder, arm, side, and stomach, that I look shortly to
become serviceable for nothing else but the worms of this
land.&#8217; He could not hope to be in England before October;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
too late for Bath, and leaving him no resource but physicians
in whom he did not believe.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The revenue.
A pestilence,</div>

<p>The Government of Ireland from April 1, 1573, to
September 30, 1575, cost the Queen more than 130,000<i>l.</i> in
ready money sent from England, besides the Irish revenue
and debts incurred but not discharged. It was a principal
part of Sidney&#8217;s instructions to devise some means of checking
this outflow. The Ulster account being almost closed, it was
supposed that he would be able to manage with 5,000<i>l.</i> a
quarter regularly paid, and that by improving the Irish
revenue even that sum might in good time be reduced.
Sidney was not likely to indulge in such golden dreams, and
he undertook the government of Ireland for the third time
with little expectation either of honour or profit. Leaving
the Queen at Dudley Castle, he landed at Skerries after
nearly losing two vessels in a storm. The summer had been
very hot, and no rain fell from May 1 to August 1. &#8216;A
loathsome disease and dreadful malady,&#8217; say the &#8216;Four Masters,&#8217;
&#8216;arose from this heat&mdash;namely, the plague, which raged
violently among the English and Irish in Dublin, Naas,
Ardee, Mullingar, and Athboy. Between those places many
a castle was left without a guard, many a flock without a
shepherd, and many a noble corpse without burial.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">and panic.</div>

<p>The whole Pale being infected, it was difficult to find a
safe resting-place. The well-to-do citizens of Dublin fled to
Drogheda, where they were grudgingly admitted, and whither
they probably brought the pestilence; for deaths occurred in
the town soon after the arrival of Essex and of the old and
new Deputies, who all reached it on the same day. Immobility
was the fault for which Fitzwilliam had been most
blamed, and his successor, by starting immediately for Carrickfergus,
no doubt meant to show that he was as capable as
ever of those rapid movements which had bewildered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
charmed the Irish mind. A blow had just been struck in
Ulster, which for the time made resistance little to be feared.
The terror of Sidney&#8217;s name might do the rest.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">General
results of
Essex&#8217;s
grant.</div>

<p>After his treaty with Tirlogh Luineach Essex had pressed
on in pursuit of the Scots from the Antrim side, the people
of the country generally showing themselves friendly. Sorley
Boy appeared in force at the Bann, on the banks of which
river an encounter took place. The Scots were worsted and
driven into Tyrone. Clandeboye was for the moment cleared
of the intruders, and Essex, as far as in him lay, handed it
over to Brian &#8216;Ertagh&#8217; O&#8217;Neill, who said that his people
were few, his cattle less, and that in striving to defend his
country from the Earl &#8216;his husbandmen were starved, dead,
or run out of the country,&#8217; which he left to the disposal of
the man who had reduced it to this condition. Such, so far
as the scheme of a settlement went, was the total result of
the grant to Essex, who was, however, so deficient in humour
as to boast &#8216;that no man in Clandeboye claimeth property in
anything, whereby your Majesty may see what this people
are when they are roughly handled.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition
to Rathlin.
Massacre.</div>

<p>His provisions failing, the Earl was obliged to quit the
field, leaving 300 foot and 850 horse at Carrickfergus under
the charge of John Norris, who had secret orders to undertake
a combined naval and military expedition against
Rathlin. With the soldiers under Norris and three frigates
under &#8216;Francis Drake, Captain of the "Falcon,"&#8217; it is not
surprising that the affair was completely successful. All the
boats at Carrickfergus were taken up, and in spite of the
winds the whole force reached the island together, and landed,
notwithstanding a vigorous resistance. The Scots retired
into their castle, which Norris proceeded to batter with two
heavy guns brought from the ship. A breach was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
made, but the first assault was repulsed, owing to the strength
of the inner defences, which were probably erected by an
Italian officer who was at this time in Sorley Boy&#8217;s service.
The same night, however, the garrison, seeing that they could
not hold out, offered to surrender for &#8216;their lives and their
goods, and to be put into Scotland, which request Captain
Norris refused, offering them as slenderly as they did largely
require: viz., to the aforesaid constable his life and his wife&#8217;s
and his child&#8217;s.... The soldiers, being moved and much
stirred with the loss of their fellows that were slain, and
desirous of revenge, made request, or rather pressed, to have
the killing of them, which they did all, saving the persons to
whom life was promised.... There were slain that came out
of the castle of all sorts 200.... They be occupied still in
killing, and have slain that they have found hidden in caves
and in the cliffs of the sea to the number of 300 or 400 more.&#8217;
Eleven Scottish galleys were burned. Three hundred kine,
3,000 sheep, 100 brood mares, and enough bere to feed
300 men for a year, were found in the island. A spy,
moreover, informed Essex that &#8216;Sorley put most of his
plate, most of his children, and the children of most part of
his gentlemen, with their wives, into the Rathlin with all
his pledges, which be all taken and executed, as the spy
saith, and in all to the number of 600. Sorley then also
stood upon the mainland of the Glynnes and saw the taking
of the island, and was like to run mad for sorrow (as the
spy saith), turning and tormenting himself, and saying that
he then lost all that ever he had.&#8217; Essex had nothing but
praise for all concerned, which indeed they deserved, if barbarity
is to incur no blame; but no one seems to have wasted
a thought on such considerations, and Queen Elizabeth vouchsafed
her unqualified thanks.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

fortified
post in

<div class="sidenote">The Scots
supreme on
the Antrim
coast.</div>

<p>Essex wished to found a permanent fortified post in
Rathlin. Norris remained behind to reap the harvest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
to hold the island until Sidney&#8217;s pleasure should be known.
In the meantime, Sorley Boy, though he had lost his children,
had not lost heart. He chose his time and swept away all
the cattle from Carrickfergus. The garrison pursued him,
got into difficult ground, and were disgracefully beaten,
owing to one of those panics to which regular troops were
always subject in their encounters with Highlanders. Some
attributed all to the prevailing dissipation, and yet Carrickfergus
was hardly a Capua. About forty Scots put the
English to flight and killed sixty of them, including Captain
Baker and his lieutenant. When Sidney came to Carrickfergus
a month later he found it &#8216;much decayed and impoverished,
no plough going at all, where before were
many; ... cattle few or none left; churches and houses,
save castles, burned; the inhabitants fled, not above six
householders of any countenance left remaining; so that their
miserable state and servile fear were to be pitied.&#8217; Of so
little use had the Rathlin massacre been that the Lord Deputy
found the Scots &#8216;very haughty and proud by reason of their
late victories had against our men, finding the baseness of
their courage.&#8217; The coast from Larne to the Bann was full of
corn and cattle, and in the undisputed possession of Sorley, who
was willing enough to come to terms, but very suspicious and
afraid of the opinion of his own followers. Sidney abandoned
Rathlin at once, saying that it was easy at any time to take,
but very expensive and useless to keep. There was a scarcity
of water about the fort, and the &#8216;Race of Rathlin&#8217; is one of the
stormiest pieces of sea on our coast. &#8216;The soldiers brought
thence being forty in number, they confessed that in this small
time of their continuance there, they were driven to kill
their horses and eat them, and to feed on them and young colts&#8217;
flesh one month before they came away.&#8217; Such was the real
value of a position where, in the opinion of Essex, 100
men &#8216;would do her Majesty more service, both against the
Scots and Irish, than 300 can do in any place within the
north parts.&#8217; Sidney thought that the Glynnes might be
handed over to Sorley Boy, no better claimant appearing, but
that the Route ought to be given back to the MacQuillins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
having been lost only because their late chief was a &#8216;dissolute
and loose fellow, feeble both of wit and force.&#8217; Lady Agnes
O&#8217;Neill, a true Campbell, met Sidney and asked for a grant of
the Glynnes for her son by James MacDonnell, offering to
defend it against Sorley Boy, and to pay a higher rent to the
Crown; but this did not recommend itself to the Lord Deputy,
wise as he thought the lady, and much as he admired her
manners and address.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hopeless
condition
of Ulster.
Sidney&#8217;s
advice.</div>

<p>The northern part of Armagh under the Baron of Dungannon
Sidney found all waste, and the cathedral in ruins.
The southern part had been granted by the Queen to the
brothers Chatterton, who were totally unable to manage the
country, and were rapidly losing all. &#8216;They wrestle and
work,&#8217; said Sidney, &#8216;and go to the worse, ... tall and
honest gentlemen, who have lost in that enterprise all that
ever they had, and all that anybody else would trust them
with, and their blood and limbs too.&#8217; The O&#8217;Hanlons would
not come to Sidney on protection, lest they should be cajoled
into acknowledging the Chattertons&#8217; title. Lecale in Down,
which was Kildare&#8217;s property, had been partially, but only
partially, peopled by the exertions of Essex. Ards was a
little better, less owing to Sir Thomas Smith than to the
natural tendencies of its old English inhabitants, whose chief,
Edmond Savage, was received into protection. Kinelarty, or
MacCartan&#8217;s country, was &#8216;all desolate and waste, full of
thieves, outlaws, and unreclaimed people. None of the old
owners dared occupy the land, because it hath pleased her
Majesty to bestow the same upon Captain Nicholas Maltby,
tied, nevertheless, to such observation of covenant and condition
as Chatterton had his.&#8217; Maltby deserved a much
better provision, but could do no good with this one either to
himself or to anyone else. He could only &#8216;make the country
altogether abandoned of inhabitants.&#8217; It was absolutely
necessary for the Queen&#8217;s service that both Chatterton&#8217;s and
Maltby&#8217;s grants should be revoked. Dufferin, long the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
property of the White family, was &#8216;all waste and desolate,
used as they of Clandeboye list.&#8217; Neill MacBrian Ertagh,
whom Essex had acknowledged as captain, made some show
of opposition at the ford of Belfast. &#8216;We passed over,&#8217; said
Sidney, &#8216;without loss of man or horse, yet, by reason of the
tide&#8217;s extraordinary return, our horses swam, and the footmen
in the passage waded very deep.... Clandeboye I found
utterly disinhabited. The captain refused to have conference
with me, and answered, "That Con MacNeill Oge was captain,
and not he" (who being appointed to be delivered to the
Marshal, by negligence of his keepers, made an escape in his
coming from Dublin, where before he remained prisoner).&#8217; It
cannot be said that the slaughter of Sir Brian MacPhelim
and his family had done much for the civilisation of Eastern
Ulster, or that the system of private conquest was any great
improvement upon native usages.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>Sidney did not visit Tyrone, Tyrconnel, Monaghan, or
Fermanagh on this occasion, but MacMahon came to Armagh,
begging to be relieved from the tyranny of O&#8217;Neill on condition
of paying the Queen rent; and O&#8217;Donnell and Maguire
wrote to the same effect. As to Tirlogh Luineach, who came
to Armagh without hesitation or condition, Sidney advised
that his messenger should be graciously received at Court,
and that his petition should be granted, excepting the authority
which he claimed over his neighbours, and that he should
be made Earl of Clan O&#8217;Neill for life. &#8216;Considering his age,
wounded and imperfect body, his ill diet, and continual surfeit,
he cannot be of long life.&#8217; Magennis also, whose country
of Iveagh had improved much since Sidney first freed it
from the O&#8217;Neills, could do little owing to the want of a title.
He might receive a full grant and the rank of Baron. The
Lord Deputy&#8217;s plan was to make all look to the Crown, without
excepting O&#8217;Neill. Advantage might be taken of the
fact that Lady Agnes &#8216;longed to have her husband like a
good subject, and to have him nobilitated.&#8217; With prophetic
clearness he showed what the result of his policy must be.

will be the dissipation of his force and strength, ... that

<div class="sidenote">Bagenal at
Newry.</div>

<p>Amid the general failure of English settlers in Ulster,
Newry, in the hands of the Marshal, Sir Nicholas Bagenal,
made a gratifying contrast. The town was well built, and
increasing fast, the lands well cultivated, &#8216;and he is much to
be commended; as well that he useth his tenants to live so
wealthily under him, as his own bounty and large hospitality
and house-keeping, so able and willing to give entertainment
to so many, and chiefly to all those that have occasion to
travel to or fro northwards, his house lying in the open highway
to their passage.&#8217; Essex had lately complained that
Bagenal would not lend him his house, but it must be admitted
that the building was well employed.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">ADMINISTRATION OF SIDNEY, 1575 TO 1577.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney and
the Butlers.</div>

<p>Fitzwilliam had always maintained that Ormonde&#8217;s presence
was the best guarantee for the peace of the South of Ireland,
and most of the Dublin officials were of the same opinion.
But Sidney disliked him, both as too powerful for a subject
and as a professed enemy of Leicester. All those who hoped
for favour from the latter, and all those who favoured the
Geraldine faction, were willing enough to take advantage of
these rivalries and jealousies. Even Sir Barnaby Fitzpatrick,
&#8216;which good knight was brought up to have known his duty
better,&#8217; but who had many causes of quarrel with his great
neighbour, took advantage of the fact that every rebellious
and disorderly person wreaked his fury upon Ormonde&#8217;s property,
which was so much scattered as not to be easily protected.
As between the Fitzpatricks and Butlers Fitzwilliam
seems to have thought that there was not much to choose,
and that both chiefs were loyal enough. But others spread
reports against Sir Edmund Butler and his brother Piers,
saying that they refused to go to the Deputy in spite of
Ormonde&#8217;s promise that they should go when sent for. It
seems that Piers went at once, and that Edward, who did
good service as Sheriff of Tipperary, was never sent for; but
some of the English Council, acting apparently under Leicester&#8217;s
influence, obtained an order from the Queen that Edward
should come in without any protection, which he immediately
did. The letter, which gave great offence to Ormonde, was
signed by Leicester, Knollys, Crofts, Smith, and Walsingham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
but not by Burghley and Sussex, though they also were
present at Kenilworth.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ormonde
and his
accusers.</div>

<p>There were some who did not spare Ormonde&#8217;s reputation
any more than his property. In times of danger he always
bore the brunt of the storm. &#8216;Who so happy,&#8217; he said, &#8216;as
the most wicked, who so unhappy as the best servant?&#8217;
When Kildare was arrested many whispered that as good a
case might be made against Ormonde. He defied all detractors
in the most uncompromising way: they were liars
and slanderers, and he only wished he knew their names. &#8216;If
the charges against Kildare,&#8217; he said, &#8216;be treasons (as I hope
they are not), I defy him and pronounce him a false villain
that spake them, if he meant them for me. For as I never
was traitor, no more was I friend of traitor, nor maintainer
of traitors. If any can charge me (as some I know would if
they could) let them say their worst: I defy them, and will
answer to defend my honour in my short [shirt], or any way
shall become a gentleman.&#8217; He added that as he was no
traitor so was he no procurer of murders, no receiver of
stolen goods, no practiser to keep stores for private gain.
On the contrary, he had subdued scoundrels of all sorts, persuaded
ill subjects to reform, opposed Scottish enemies, spent
his living in her Majesty&#8217;s service, &#8216;as my house has ever
been, which some perhaps may envy.&#8217; He was accused of
seeking revenge against those that robbed him and burned
his villages, and against those who harboured felons. &#8216;My
lord,&#8217; he pleaded, &#8216;when my neighbours be lawless, not
coming to assizes or sessions, what amends may I have by
justice, though by that means I seek mine own?&#8217; He complained
that his enemies at Court remembered him better
than his friends; but he was all along secure in the Queen&#8217;s
personal favour, even if his great services had proved a weak
defence. She took care to tell him privately that she believed
no stories against him, and commanded him to write
often. &#8216;Yet one thing,&#8217; she added, &#8216;you seem to have forgotten,
and wherefore we have some cause to be displeased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
with you, as though of anything that you write to ourself any
person living should be made privy but ourself alone.&#8217; It is
hard to guess what the matter was which Ormonde was afraid
to trust to paper and which Elizabeth wished to be so profound
a secret; but the passage quoted shows what very
great favour he enjoyed.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Sir Peter
Carew.</div>

<p>Sir Peter Carew, the original cause of the quarrel which
had made the Butlers rebels for once, left the scene soon after
Sidney&#8217;s return to Ireland. He was again preparing to prosecute
his claims in Munster, and Hooker had been at Cork
making overtures to chiefs living west of the city, many of
whom promised to accept Carew as their landlord and to pay
him rent. Three thousand cows, worth as many marks, were
offered in discharge of all arrears. Desmond and others promised
to make him welcome, houses were taken for him both
at Cork and Kinsale, and arrangements were made for provisions;
but Sir Peter fell ill and died unexpectedly at New
Ross, his Munster projects dying with him. He left his
Idrone property to his nephew and namesake, who was also
continued in the government of Leighlin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
character.</div>

<p>Sir Peter Carew was a good specimen of the Tudor
adventurer: loyal, brave, chivalrous and generous to lavishness;
with large ideas and great energy, but capable of
actions which will not bear minute inspection. Sincerely
religious, though no theologian, it was noted that he never
broke bread or prepared himself for sleep without saying some
prayer, and he gave substantial help to Protestants wherever
he found them. &#8216;He had his imperfections,&#8217; says his friend
and biographer, &#8216;yet was he not known to be wrapt in the
dissolute net of Venus, nor embrued with the cup of Bacchus;
he was not carried with the blind covetousness of Plutus, nor
yet subject to malice, envy, or any notorious crime.&#8217; Without
regular education he had picked up a thorough knowledge of
French and Italian, had read a good deal in both languages,
and had that intelligent love of architecture which was somewhat
characteristic of the time. He had much of the many-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>sidedness
distinguishing the Elizabethan era, and seldom seen
in this age of specialists.</p>

<p>On his deathbed, though he suffered greatly, he was as
steadfast as of old when he supported Sir John Cheke&#8217;s
fainting spirit, &#8216;yielding himself wholly to the good will and
pleasure of God, before whom he poured out continually his
prayers, and in praying did gasp out his last breath, and yield
up his spirit.&#8217; Only a few months before his death the Queen
praised his experience, wisdom, and courage; and when he
was dead she granted the prayer of his many friends in carrying
out the wishes of this &#8216;trusty and true Englishman.&#8217; He
was buried at Waterford with great pomp, and a stately
cenotaph, raised by the piety of Hooker, commemorates him
in Exeter Cathedral. When his corpse was being lowered
into the grave, Sidney, who happened to be at Waterford,
pronounced the following eulogium:&mdash;&#8216;Here lieth now, in his
last rest, a most worthy, and noble, gentle knight, whose
faith to his prince was never yet stained, his truth to his
country never spotted, and his valiantness in service never
doubted&mdash;a better subject the prince never had.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney&#8217;s
tour.</div>

<p>It was not Sidney&#8217;s way to let the grass grow under his
feet, and he had no sooner returned from Ulster than he started
on another journey. Louth he found greatly impoverished
by the constant passage of soldiers north and south, and
the towns of Dundalk and Ardee were miserable enough.
Drogheda had profited somewhat by Essex&#8217;s profuse expenditure.
Bagenal&#8217;s settlement was strong enough to defend the
north border of the Pale, except on the side of Ferney, which
was granted to Essex, but where he had not yet done anything.
Meath the Lord Deputy found &#8216;cursedly scorched on the outside&#8217;
by the O&#8217;Connors and O&#8217;Molloys, who were equally bad
neighbours when in open rebellion and when under protection.
O&#8217;Reilly, on the contrary, used the Pale well, and he himself
was &#8216;the justest Irishman, and his the best ruled Irish
country, by an Irishman, that is in all Ireland.&#8217; Westmeath
suffered much from anarchy and from Irish neighbours, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
there was good hope of reformation through the activity and
discretion of Lord Delvin. The O&#8217;Ferralls had consented to
have Longford made a shire. They had taken estates of inheritance,
and promised speedily to pay their quit-rents,
which had been in arrears since Sidney&#8217;s last visit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miserable
state of
Leinster.</div>

<p>On the borders of Dublin and what is now Wicklow
cattle-lifting went on merrily by night and day, under the
superintendence of Feagh MacHugh O&#8217;Byrne, who was just
rising into celebrity. Kildare was impoverished, more especially
the Earl&#8217;s own property, by the incursion of the O&#8217;Mores,
and old Henry Cowley &#8216;with tears in his eyes&#8217; told the Lord
Deputy that the Barony of Carbery was 3,000<i>l.</i> poorer than
when they had last met. Carlow was more than half waste
through outlaws of various kinds, &#8216;some living under Sir
Edmund Butler,&#8217; and it was to be feared that Sir Peter
Carew&#8217;s place would be ill-supplied by his young kinsman.
The side of Wexford which bordered on Carlow and Kilkenny
was also in very evil case. Wicklow was quiet, with the exception
of Feagh MacHugh, but Agard the seneschal was
away in England, and his absence threatened to be dangerous.
The Kavanaghs were tolerably quiet, &#8216;and though much in
arrears of rent, yet pay it they will and shall.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">King&#8217;s and
Queen&#8217;s
Counties.</div>

<p>The settlement of the King&#8217;s and Queen&#8217;s Counties threatened
to succumb to &#8216;the race and offspring of the old native
inhabiters, which grow great and increase in number, and
the English tenants decay and let their lands to Irish tenants....
200 men, at the least, in the Prince&#8217;s pay lie there to
defend them. The revenue of both countries countervails not
the twentieth part of the charge; so that the purchase of that
plot is and hath been very dear, yet now not to be given over
in any wise.&#8217; Sidney advised caution in undertaking any
more enterprises of the kind. &#8216;Rory Oge O&#8217;More hath the
possession and settling-place in the Queen&#8217;s County, whether
the tenants will or no, as he occupieth what he listeth and
wasteth what he will.&#8217; Upper Ossory, under Sir Barnaby
Fitzpatrick, now a Baron, was in good order, and needed only
to be joined to some shire. O&#8217;Dunne&#8217;s country was in good case,
&#8216;the lord of it a valiant and honest man after this country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
manner.&#8217; Sidney made the Baron Lieutenant over both King&#8217;s
and Queen&#8217;s Counties, and found every reason to be satisfied
with the appointment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kilkenny
and Waterford.</div>

<p>Kilkenny, &#8216;the sink and receptacle&#8217; of stolen goods, was
not found to have profited much by the continuance of
coyne and livery, &#8216;which yet was done by order, and for the
avoidance of a greater, or, at the least, a more present evil.&#8217;
Ormonde, though he had no love for Sidney, entertained him
very handsomely, and gave his word to Rory Oge, who accordingly
came in and solemnly in the cathedral submitted
and promised amendment. The Earl was made Lieutenant
of Tipperary and Kilkenny, and he then escorted Sidney to
Waterford, where the citizens feasted him with shows and
rejoicings both by land and water.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney in
Munster.</div>

<p>From Waterford Sidney went to stay at Curraghmore with
Lord Power, and found his country &#8216;comparable with the best
ordered county in the English Pale: whereby a manifest and
most certain proof may be conceived what benefit riseth both
to the Prince, mesne lord, and inferior subject, by suppressing
of coyne and livery.&#8217; Lord Power&#8217;s neighbour, Sir James
Fitzgerald, who had succeeded his brother Sir Maurice but
without the title of Viscount Decies, ruled a district four
times as large, with the result of making it so waste &#8216;as it is
not able to find competent food for a mean family in good
order; yet are there harboured and live more idle vagabonds
than good cattle bred.&#8217; The smaller country gentlemen, as
well as the citizens who held mortgages, were anxious to live
quietly and pay their taxes. Desmond himself came to
Sidney at Dungarvan, and &#8216;very humbly offered any service
that he was able to do to her Majesty.&#8217; The town was half
ruined by the late rebellion of James Fitzmaurice, but Henry
Davells, the constable, was labouring with some success to
restore it, and to punish malefactors. The people of Youghal
pleaded that they had suffered too much by the rebellion to
bear the cost of a viceregal reception, and Sidney passed by
Castle Martyr to Barry&#8217;s Court, and thence to Cork. Kin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>sale,
which the Deputy visited a little later, he found much
decayed; the castle and pier both so ruinous that the townsmen
were almost defenceless against both pirates and gales.
But they were loyal and willing to help themselves, and
Sidney gave them a small sum to spend in wages, on condition
that they should supply everything else, and not rest till
both castle and pier were again serviceable. He was much
struck by the advantages of the Old Head for a fortified post.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cork.
The nobles
flock to
Sidney.</div>

<p>The citizens of Cork received the Lord Deputy with
manifestations of joy, and willingly allowed the troops
quarters for six weeks. The soldiers paid half their wages
for board, lodging, and fire, and this arrangement satisfied all
parties. The Earls of Desmond, Thomond, and Clancare, the
Archbishop of Cashel, the Bishops of Cork and Cloyne and
of Ross, Viscounts Barry and Roche, and Lords Courcy,
Lixnaw, Dunboyne, Power, and Barry Oge attended Sidney
the whole time of his stay, as did also Lord Louth, &#8216;who only
to do me honour came out of the English Pale to that city,
and did great good among great ones; for being of this
country birth, and of their language and well understanding
their conditions and manners, did by example of himself,
being but a mean man of lands in respect of their large
patrimonies and living, both at home and abroad, live more
commendably than they did or were able to do; which did
much persuade them to leave their barbarity and to be
ashamed of their wilful misery.&#8217; MacCarthy Reagh and
MacCarthy of Muskerry were also present, and made a good
impression on Sidney. They seemed to him, both for their
possessions and their law-abiding disposition, to be worthy of
baronies at least. The latter especially, well known in Irish
history as Sir Cormac MacTeigue, was, he thought &#8216;the rarest
man that ever was born in the Irishry; of him I intend to
write specially, for truly he is a special man.&#8217; O&#8217;Mahon came
from the shores of Dunmanus Bay and O&#8217;Donoghue from the
Lakes of Killarney, and there was scarcely an important chief,
whether English or Irish, who was not present; Sir John of
Desmond and his brother James and Sir Thomas Roe being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
particularly assiduous in their attendance. &#8216;There came also
many of the ruined relics of the ancient English inhabitants
of this province, as the Arundels, Rochfords, Barretts,
Flemings, Lombards, Tirries, and many others whose ancestors,
as it may appear by monuments, as well in writing
as of building, were able, and did live like gentlemen and
knights; and now all in misery, either banished from their
own or oppressed upon their own.&#8217; As representatives of the
Celtic order, to which that of the Anglo-Normans had given
place, came five MacSwineys, captains of gallowglasses,
originally from Donegal, but maintained by the Desmonds
and others as condottieri. They had no lands, but were of
as much power and consequence as any landowners, &#8216;the
greatest being both in fear of them and glad of their friendship.&#8217;
Finally, Sidney records that most of the chiefs brought
their wives, &#8216;who truly kept very honourable, at least very
plentiful houses,&#8217; and there were many widows of consideration,
including some dowager countesses.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">James
Fitzmaurice.</div>

<p>Sidney knew too much about Ireland to be sanguine, but
he hoped that the Munster lords would consent to support
100 English foot and 50 English horse free of charge to the
Queen. They generally professed themselves ready to do
this from May 1, 1576, though the sincerity of one or two
great ones was doubtful. But a cloud was gathering in the
distance; James Fitzmaurice having fled to France early in
1575 with his wife and children and several companions, of
whom the most important were the seneschal of Imokilly,
a son of the Knight of Glin, and Edmund Fitzgibbon, eldest
surviving son of the late White Knight, and claiming that
dignity in spite of his father&#8217;s attainder. Fitzmaurice maintained
that his object was to make interest abroad for the
Queen&#8217;s pardon, and both he and the White Knight asked
Ormonde to intercede for them. To Englishmen in France
he said that he had been driven from Ireland by Desmond&#8217;s
unkindness, who had refused to give him the means of living,
and that he had been forced to bring his wife and children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
with him because he had no house of his own in Ireland.
This tallies with the statements of the family historians, one
of whom attributes Desmond&#8217;s conduct to the influence of his
wife, who could not bear to see her only son deprived of any
portion of his vast heritage. A ship of war followed the
fugitives to France, and Captain Thornton gave an interesting
account of their proceedings.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzmaurice
lands in
France,
1576,</div>

<p>Sailing from Glin in the Shannon, on board La Arganys
of St. Malo, whose master, Michael Garrett, was no doubt
a fellow-clansman, the Geraldine party landed at a village in
Brittany. They brought 1,000<i>l.</i> worth of plate with them,
and had, therefore, no difficulty in exchanging their Irish
costume for French clothes. While the tailors were still at
work they received visits from the chief townsmen of St.
Malo, and when the transformation was complete, they all
repaired to the town. The Governor and other principal
people with their wives met them on the sands, and brought
them to their lodgings at Captain Garrett&#8217;s house. Here
Mrs. Fitzmaurice and her family remained, but Fitzmaurice
with half-a-dozen companions went on to Nantes, and from
thence to Paris. He received money and good words, and it
was officially given out that his object was to gain a pardon
from Queen Elizabeth through French intercession. Latin
versions of letters purporting to be written by Henry III. to
the Queen and to De la Motte Fénelon were shown in Ireland
by Geraldine partisans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">where he
is well received.</div>

<p>The report circulated at St. Malo was that Fitzmaurice
came to seek help against Desmond; but Mrs. Fitzmaurice
made no secret of her proclivities, for she refused an invitation
to dine on board a Bordeaux vessel, &#8216;because Englishmen,
her enemies, were to be there.&#8217; Nor were the better
informed ignorant that the whole enterprise was directed
against England. A Devonshire merchant talked with a
French officer who, in ignorance of his nationality, said that
the King would have no peace with the wicked English, that
St. Malo had furnished ships against Rochelle which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
have been attacked long ago but for fear of the English naval
power, and that a war with England was the one thing needful
to unite all parties.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His life at
St. Malo.</div>

<p>After his visit to the French Court, Fitzmaurice returned
again to St. Malo, and in the early days of 1576 Sidney thus
reported concerning him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;He keepeth a great port, himself and family well
apparelled and full of money; he hath oft intelligence from
Rome and out of Spain; not much relief from the French
King, as I can perceive, yet oft visited by men of good countenance.
This much I know of certain report, by special of
mine own from St. Malo. The man, subtle, malicious, and
hardy, a Papist in extremity, and well esteemed and of good
credit among the people. If he come and be not wholly dealt
withal at the first (as without an English commander I know
he shall not), all the loose people of Munster will flock unto
him: yea, the lords, though they would do their best, shall
not be able to keep them from him. So if he come while I
am in the North, he may do what he will with Kinsale, Cork,
Youghal, Kilmallock, and haply Limerick too, before I shall
be able to come to the rescue thereof.&#8217;</p>

<p>From St. Malo Fitzmaurice wrote to the General of the
Jesuits for a confessor, offering to pay all his travelling expenses
and to support him liberally. After a time he might,
if it were thought desirable, be sent into Ireland as a missionary
to the rude and unlearned people.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney at
Limerick.
Thomond.
Connaught.</div>

<p>After his tour in Munster, Sidney proceeded from
Limerick to take a like survey of Connaught and Thomond.
He was attended by the Earl of Thomond and the other
chiefs of the O&#8217;Briens, &#8216;of one surname, and so near kinsmen
as they descend of one grandfather, and yet no one of them
friend to another;&#8217; the east and west Macnamaras, Macmahon,
O&#8217;Loghlen, and many other gentlemen. Few as the
people were, the Lord Deputy found the country too poor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
feed them, &#8216;if they were not of a more spare diet than others
are.&#8217; He spent his first night comfortably enough in the
dissolved friary at Quin, the beautiful ruins of which still
remain, the second at Kilmacduagh, which is also interesting
to the antiquarian, but which must have been a poor
cathedral city at its best. Here Clanricarde met him, and
he passed by Gort to Galway, whither all the principal men
of Thomond repaired to him. He found that there had been
no lack of murders, rapes, burnings, and sacrileges. So hard
was the swearing that the injuries to property might be
esteemed infinite in number, immeasurable in quantity, until
the legal acumen of Sir Lucas Dillon reduced them within
reasonable bounds. On examination it appeared that the
greatest harm had arisen from the feud between Thomond
and his cousin Teige MacMurrough, and they were required
to enter into heavy recognizances. Sir Donnell O&#8217;Brien, the
Earl&#8217;s brother, was made sheriff of the county of Clare, a
shire of Sidney&#8217;s own creation. Connaught was now divided
into four counties&mdash;Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, and Sligo.
From Mayo came seven men to represent the seven septs of
Clandonnells, the hereditary gallowglasses of North-West
Connaught, and in effect the tyrants of the country. They
agreed without difficulty to hold their lands of the Queen,
and so did MacWilliam Eighter himself, who communicated
with the Lord Deputy in Latin, and made a very
favourable impression. MacWilliam agreed to pay 250
marks yearly, and to support 200 soldiers for two months in
each year, and an English sheriff was established in Mayo at
his request. Besides the various septs of Burkes, Sidney
enumerates five great English families who had taken Celtic
names, and who now followed MacWilliam&#8217;s lead; as did
O&#8217;Malley, &#8216;an original Irishman, strong in gallies and seamen.&#8217;
The five chiefs of English race claimed to be Barons
of Parliament, &#8216;and they had land enough, but so bare,
barbarous barons are they now that they have not three
hackneys to carry them and their train home.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Galway.</div>

<p>Galway itself was much decayed through the outrage of
Clanricarde&#8217;s sons, and the townsmen so much disheartened
as to be almost ready to abandon their post. Sidney&#8217;s
presence revived them, and all men hastened to pay their
respects; among them the Archbishop of Tuam, the Bishops
of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh, and Birmingham, Baron of
Athenry, &#8216;as poor a baron as liveth, and yet agreed on to be
the ancientest baron in this land.&#8217; O&#8217;Flaherty, O&#8217;Madden,
O&#8217;Kelly, and other Celts also appeared, as well as the heads
of several septs of Clanricarde Burkes, each with his appropriate
Irish name. The Earl&#8217;s sons came into church on
Sunday, surrendered at discretion, and were brought prisoners
to Dublin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Athenry.
The Connaught
clans.
Sidney&#8217;s
reflections,</div>

<p>After spending three weeks at Galway, during which the
hangman was not idle, Sidney went to Athenry, which he
found in ashes, the very church not being spared by the
young Burkes, though the mother of one of them was buried
there. To rebuild the town a tax, according to a principle
not yet forgotten in Ireland, was assessed upon the country,
and the work was immediately begun. The castles of Ballinasloe
and Clare Galway were garrisoned for the Queen, and
Sidney then went by Roscommon to Athlone. On his way
he noted that Clanricarde&#8217;s vassals were well enough off,
but that all else was ruinous. O&#8217;Connor Don, MacDermot,
and others here paid their respects. From the newly made
County of Longford the gentlemen came willingly enough to
Roscommon and Athlone, and promised to clear off the 200
marks of revenue, which was four or five years in arrear.
Part of the money was actually paid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and proposals.</div>

<p>On his return to Dublin, Sidney insisted strongly upon
the necessity of two Presidents. Sir William Denny was
already named for Munster, and he proposed Essex or Sir
Edward Montague for Connaught. English lawyers he must
have, or no justice could be done. A standing army of 1,000
men he must have, or no peace could be kept. Two or three
good officials&mdash;men like Tremayne&mdash;were much wanted if
the revenue was to be increased. And then, above all, the
Church must be reformed, &#8216;for so deformed and overthrown a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
Church there is not, I am sure, in any region where Christ is
professed; and preposterous it seemeth to me to begin reformation
of the politic part, and to neglect the religious.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evil condition
of the
Irish
Church.</div>

<p>The facts as to the religious state of Ireland were laid by
Sidney before the Queen herself, and go far to explain the
comparative failure of Anglicanism in Ireland. Hugh Brady,
Bishop of Meath, a native of his diocese and a man of Irish
race, though a sincere Protestant, had lately made a parochial
visitation of his own diocese. Brady, who was the Lord
Deputy&#8217;s companion during part of his Western journey, is
described by him as honest, zealous, and godly; to such a man
the state of the churches under his charge must have given
the gravest anxiety. There were 224 parish churches, of
which 105 were impropriated to manors or possessed by the
holders of monasteries which had come into the hands of the
Crown. In not one of these cases was there a resident
parson or vicar, and of the &#8216;very simple and sorry curates&#8217;
usually appointed to do duty only eighteen could speak
English, the rest being &#8216;Irish priests or rather Irish rogues,
having very little Latin, less learning or civility.&#8217; They
gained a precarious living from the offertory, and in no single
case was there a dwelling-house. Many of the churches
were down altogether; the great majority without roofs.
Fifty-two churches were ill served by vicars, and fifty-two
more in the hands of private patrons were in somewhat better
but still poor case. We are left to infer that only thirteen
out of 224 parishes were in such a state as the Bishop could
approve. Meath was the best peopled and richest diocese in
Ireland, and Sidney, not to tire the Queen with too many
details, left her to guess what the dry tree was like. &#8216;Your
Majesty may believe that upon the face of the earth, where
Christ is professed, there is not a church in so miserable
a case.&#8217; With ruinous churches, want of labourers for the
vineyard, and want of means to pay them, Sidney had no
difficulty in believing that the very sacrament of baptism had
fallen into disuse.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Remedies
proposed.</div>

<p>The remedies proposed were that the churches should be
repaired out of the profits of the land, either by the Crown
or by the tenants as equity might dictate, that Irish-speaking
ministers should be sought at the universities or borrowed
from the Regent of Scotland, and that some of the English
bishops should be forced to visit Ireland, with their own eyes
and at their own expense to see the spiritual nakedness of
the land, and to prescribe a cure. &#8216;They be rich enough,&#8217;
he added, &#8216;and if either they be thankful to your Majesty for
the immense bounty done to them, or zealous to increase the
Christian flock, they will not refuse this honourable and
religious travel; and I will undertake their guiding and guarding
honourably and safely from place to place; the great
desire that I have to have such from thence is for that I hope
to find them not only grave in judgment, but void of affection.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Expenses
of government.</div>

<p>After his return from Connaught, Sidney busied himself
with the revenue and general administration. He did not
conceal from himself that for every penny of rent she received
it cost the Queen a shilling to hold her own. &#8216;Yet,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;I will never consent that the country should be abandoned
in any sort, for held it shall be; but only hereby to note
unto you by the way, what a dear purchase this is and hath
been to the Crown; and, by the example of this, you may
judge of the rest that are of this nature.&#8217; Sir William Drury,
the new President of Munster, and William Gerrard, the new
Chancellor, were promised in April but did not come till
Midsummer, and in the meantime &#8216;the southern like the
dog, the northern like the hog, mentioned in the holy book,
were ready to revolt to their innate and corrupt vilety.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>O&#8217;Rourke, whom Sidney notes as the proudest man he
ever saw in Ireland, came to Dublin and produced a patent
of Henry VIII. which proved genuine. 20<i>l.</i> Irish was the
rent reserved, but Sidney held out for 200<i>l.</i> sterling, and
O&#8217;Rourke agreed to submit his cause to commissioners.
O&#8217;Donnell also agreed to pay the 200 marks or 300 beeves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
which he had long since promised, asking only time for
arrears. Sidney inquired into the very old dispute as to the
tenure by which O&#8217;Connor held Sligo. O&#8217;Donnell said that
300 marks sterling had been paid to him and his ancestors
since St. Patrick&#8217;s time. This was dismissed as fabulous, but
a prescription of some generations was shown, while O&#8217;Connor
convinced Sidney that the payment had never been made
without violence, offering to give 100 marks a year to be quit
of O&#8217;Donnell and to receive a sheriff peaceably, a &#8216;foreigner&#8217;
being preferred to an inhabitant of the country. Many other
chiefs came to Dublin, and were ready to pay some yearly sum
&#8216;all for justice; it is to be rejoiced that they so do, but more
to be lamented that they have it not near to them.&#8217; The
Lord Deputy thought it very hard that he should have to do
his own work and that of the President also; and, indeed,
his post was no sinecure, for during the nine months that he
had been in Ireland 400 men had been executed &#8216;by commission
ordinary and extraordinary, and by slaughter in
defence of the poor husbandmen.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>The delay in appointing a President for Connaught, and

soon restored their courage to the Earl of Clanricarde&#8217;s sons.
Such English officers as were in Connaught Fitton described
as mean men, and as meek as mice to the Earl and his
sons, and yet mean as they were too much for the young
men. They suddenly crossed the Shannon, and cast off their
English clothes with the remark, &#8216;Lie there for one year at
least.&#8217; The old Earl wrote to say that he would prevent
them doing harm till he heard from the Deputy, to whom he
scarcely offered any excuse. Writing to Ormonde and Lord
Upper Ossory, he said that the 6,000<i>l.</i> which the rebuilding
of Athenry would cost was too much for his country to bear,
and that he himself could not raise 500<i>l.</i> The young men,
paying but little attention to promises made in their names,
destroyed the few houses which had been restored in the ill-fated
town, killed or dispersed the labourers, burned the new
gate, and sought for the stone with the royal arms, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
might break it, swearing that no such stone should stand in
any wall there. Fearing for the safety of Galway, Sidney
prepared to chastise the rebels in person.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney and
Clanricarde.</div>

<p>The Lord Deputy only received the news on Tuesday, and
on Friday he was at Athlone with a few officers; the bulk of
his forces following as they could. Clanricarde came in on
protection, which was granted unwillingly, and surrendered
Loughreagh as a material guarantee. Kneeling at Sidney&#8217;s
feet, the Earl besought pardon for himself and his sons, still
maintaining that excessive taxation was the only cause of
the rebellion. The Deputy sternly reminded him that the
county had agreed to the rates imposed, and gave him leave
to depart unscathed within three days. This was on Friday,
and on the following Sunday Clanricarde came into the
parish church and made submission on his knees, confessing
the treason of his sons, and submitting himself and his cause
to her Majesty&#8217;s pleasure. Sidney professed himself glad to
gain an Earl and his castles instead of &#8216;two beggarly bastard
boys,&#8217; but tacitly admitted their power to annoy by pressing
once more for a President. &#8216;Without a sufficient man in
that office,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I shall but trindle Sisyphus&#8217; stone and
bring it to the brim of the bank, and then forced to turn
both head and hand, and so haply break either back or neck,
but that is the least matter. In the meantime the Queen
shall lose both honour and treasure, and her people lack
both distribution of justice among them, surety of their lives,

<div class="sidenote">Sir
William
Drury,
President
of Munster,
1576.
Sidney in
Connaught.</div>

<p>Having secured Galway and Athlone, Sidney went to
Limerick, where he settled Sir William Drury in his presidency.
Drury was a native of Suffolk, who had served
England well by sea and land, at home and abroad. He had
been Governor of Berwick, and had superintended the siege of
Edinburgh Castle, where, in spite of Grange&#8217;s chivalry and
Maitland&#8217;s guile, that last fortress of a falling cause had sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>rendered
to Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s ally. He was now to try
what skill and courage could effect in the service which had
been, and was to be, fatal to the fortunes of so many eminent
Englishmen. Meanwhile the young Burkes&mdash;the MacIarlas
as they were called&mdash;held the open country with 2,000 Scots,
besides their usual rabble. Captains Collier and Strange
were besieged in Loughreagh, but Sidney thought the place
practically impregnable by such a force, and prepared at his
leisure to strike a well-aimed blow. Early in September he
entered Connaught again, accompanied by Maltby, who had
been appointed military Governor of the province, by a
number of Ormonde&#8217;s men under the command of Edward
Butler, and by his own son Philip, whose &#8216;sufficiency,
honesty, virtue, and zeal&#8217; made him remarkable even in his
twenty-second year. Maltby and Butler chased John Burke
and his rabble up and down the country, but could never
come up with them. On Sidney drawing towards the
borders of Mayo, the Scots, fearing to have their retreat cut
off, fled precipitately into Ulster. All the English officers
were agreed that the state of Connaught was owing to the
lawlessness and ambition of the Earl and his sons&mdash;&#8216;two
cursed young men&#8217;&mdash;who would brook no superior. The
people would gladly be rid of their tyranny, but had been
taught by experience that great culprits generally escaped
justice, and returned to plague those who had ventured to
withstand them. No help, though much passive sympathy,
could, therefore, be hoped for by viceroy or provincial
governor.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>Sir William Drury found plenty to do in his new government,
though the county was free from any great disturbance.
At Cork assizes forty-two persons were hanged, and one
pressed to death; a chief of the MacSwiney gallowglasses,
who had displayed a banner while driving cattle from under
the walls of Cork, being among the sufferers. In derision
the same banner was borne before the culprit to the place
of execution. Nearly as many more were despatched at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Limerick, the President&#8217;s object being to strike down the
local ringleaders as much as possible. &#8216;They ride,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;all one horse, and the head of the salmon is worth a many
small fishes.&#8217; Like every other English governor, Drury
complained of the number of idle men retained by territorial
magnates. All he could do was to procure that registers
should be kept, showing on whom each kerne or gallowglass
was dependent, thus making the gentlemen responsible.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>In this temper he asked for leave to visit England. It
was granted, and at the end of October 1575 he landed near
his own house at Lanfey in Pembrokeshire. Even during
the passage his ill-fortune pursued him. Vessels carrying
his servants and baggage were dispersed by a storm, and the
rough weather told upon his enfeebled frame. He was
accompanied by Maltby, who was for the moment unemployed,
and who thoroughly sympathised with him; but his
health was so bad that Walsingham cautioned him not to
travel too fast towards London. When he did arrive there
he had still to complain of neglect, and of the expense to
which he was put in dancing attendance on Queen and
Ministers. Burghley found it necessary to &#8216;humiliate the
style&#8217; of the Earl&#8217;s letters before showing them to her
Majesty, and he then wrote in a more submissive strain. It
was this, probably, which elicited from the Queen one of
those letters with which she well knew how to whistle back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
her disgusted servants. She congratulated him on his perfect
conquest over his passions, which she attributed to the
lessons of patience learned in the Irish service. &#8216;And
though,&#8217; she said, &#8216;you may think that it has been a dear
conquest unto you in respect of the great care of mind, toil
of body, and the intolerable charges you have sustained to
the consumption of some good portion of your patrimony, yet
if the great reputation you have gained be weighed in the
balance of just value, or tried at the touchstone of true
desert, it shall then appear that neither your mind&#8217;s care,
your body&#8217;s toil, nor purse&#8217;s charge was unprofitably employed;
for by the decay of those things that are subject to
corruption and mortality you have, as it were, invested yourself
with immortal renown, the true mark that every honourable
mind ought to shoot at.... We think your demands made
upon us were grounded both upon the respect of your own
benefit and of our service, interpreting as we do the word
benefit not to import that servile gain that base-minded men
hunt after, but a desire to live in action and to make proof
of your virtue; and being made of the metal you are, not unprofitably
or rather reproachfully to fester in the delights of
English Egypt, when the most part of those that are bred in
that soil take great delight in holding their noses over the
beef-pots.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Return and
death of
Essex.</div>

<p>In the end Essex received a grant of the barony of
Farney in Monaghan, of the peninsula called Island Magee
in Antrim, and of the office of Earl Marshal in Ireland for
life. Having made his will and such other arrangements as
were possible for the settlement of his estate, he returned to
Ireland after an absence of about nine months. The leading
of 300 men for which he had asked, and which Sidney
recommended, would probably have been granted had not
death cut his career short. He reached Dublin on July 23,
1576, and on August 30 was attacked by dysentery, which
carried him off in three weeks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His character.</div>

<p>In his lifetime Essex did many things which history must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
condemn, though he seems not in any way to have accused
himself. On his deathbed he showed himself a hero, if
patience under suffering and faith without worldly hope are
to be considered heroic attributes. Two days before his death
he wrote to Elizabeth, besought her forgiveness for any offence
he might have given, and begged her to be a mother to his
children. He reminded her that his son would be poor
through his debts to the Crown, and that she would be no
loser by remitting them, since the minor&#8217;s wardship would
amount to as much or more. In another letter he recommended
his son to the care of Burghley and Sussex, &#8216;to the
end that he might frame himself to the example of my Lord
of Sussex in all the actions of his life, tending either to the
wars, or to the institution of a noble man, so he might also
reverence your lordship for your wisdom and gravity, and
lay up your counsels and advice in the treasury of his heart.&#8217;
He sent his love to Philip Sidney, &#8216;and wished him so well
that if God do move both their hearts, I wish that he might
match with my daughter. I call him son; he so wise, so
virtuous, and godly; and if he go on in the course he hath
begun, he will be as famous and worthy a gentleman as ever
England bred.&#8217; As regards Sidney he spoke prophetically,
and it is but reasonable to suppose that had Penelope
Devereux become his wife she would have been the glory
instead of the scandal of her age. With almost his last words
he sang a hymn which he had composed, and at the end &#8216;he
strove to praise even when his voice could not be heard.&#8217;
When it failed altogether, Mr. Waterhouse&mdash;his faithful friend
always&mdash;&#8216;holding him by the hands, bade him give a sign if
he understood the prayers, and at the name of Jesus he held
up both his hands, and with that fell asleep in Christ as
meekly as a lamb.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Leicester&#8217;s
conduct to
Essex.</div>

<p>The Jesuit Parsons accused Leicester of poisoning Essex,
and he was probably not incapable of such a deed. The
charge was made at the time, but Sidney&#8217;s contemporary
account fully disposes of what he calls &#8216;a false and malicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
brute,&#8217; and the accusation was not made by any of those who
were about the sick bed, nor was it believed by the dying
man himself. But if Leicester is to be acquitted of poisoning
the man whose widow he married, it is not so easy to clear
him of having gained her affections clandestinely while using
his political influence to keep her husband at a distance. In
one letter Leicester hints that Essex does not expose his own
person enough, and speaks somewhat slightingly of his
abilities; nevertheless, he was angry with Sidney for not
doing more to facilitate his return to Ireland. On the other
hand, it would appear that Essex was on friendly terms with
Leicester. What seems really clear is that Essex did not
care much for his wife. His will contains no loving mention
of her, and his last letter to the Queen speaks of the burden
which dowries would lay upon his son&#8217;s inheritance. On his
deathbed he spoke much of his daughters, lamenting the
time which &#8216;is so frail and ungodly, considering the frailness
of woman.&#8217; While asking Elizabeth to be a mother to his
son, he abstained from saying a word about that son&#8217;s natural
mother. And it is evident that he cared little for his wife&#8217;s
society; for after the failure of his great enterprise he was
ready to live &#8216;altogether private in a corner of Ulster,&#8217; rather
than return home. The facts seem to exonerate Leicester
from the charge of poisoning, but tally very well with the
common report that he kept the Earl in Ireland while he
made love to the Countess.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Agitation
against the
cess.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The truth
hard to
discover.</div>

<p>The Queen continually upbraided Sidney with the expense
of his government. He, on the contrary, maintained that there
was no waste, and that the cost of supporting an army, without
which government was impossible, grew greater every day.
There had been a rise in prices unaccompanied by any increase
in revenue, and the soldier found it hard to live without
being burdensome to the country. The gentlemen of the
Pale now took the high ground that no tax could be imposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
except by Parliament or a Grand Council, though the cess
was a customary payment, which in one form or another had
been exacted since Henry IV.&#8217;s time. Sidney stood upon the
prerogative, in this case strengthened by custom, &#8216;and not
limited by Magna Charta, nor found in Littleton&#8217;s Tenures, nor
written in the Book of Assizes, but registered in the remembrance
of her Majesty&#8217;s Exchequer, and remaining in the
Rolls of Records of the Tower, as her Majesty&#8217;s treasure.&#8217; It
was this Elizabethan way of looking at things that brought
Charles I. to the scaffold, but in Sidney&#8217;s time no one thought
such language strange. The theory that there should be no
taxation without consent of Parliament was beginning to be
advanced, but few were as yet so bold as openly to propose
limits to the royal power. The efficiency of ill-paid soldiers
is generally small, and many landlords said they could
defend themselves better and more cheaply. The Lords
of the Pale were usually called to the Council Board, and had
ample opportunities of protesting against the cess. They
admitted that it had been regularly imposed for thirty years
for victualling the army, and more lately for the viceregal
household. The old &#8216;Queen&#8217;s prices&#8217; were not far from the
real value, but they had crystallised into fixed rates, while
the market had steadily risen, and was now about 150 per
cent. higher. No doubt it was difficult to assess payments
in kind. &#8216;The country,&#8217; said Lord Chancellor Gerard, &#8216;set
down notes falsifying the victuallers&#8217; proportion. Because
they varied in the weight of every beef and the number of
loaves which every peck of corn would make, I played the
butcher and baker on several market days, and weighed
of the best, meanest, and worst sort of beeves, and also
weighed the peck of corn and received the same by weight in
loaves, containing the weight of 3 lbs. every loaf of bread;
and found the same neither too weighty as the country set
down, nor too light as the victuallers allege,&#8217; &amp;c.</p>

<p>The country, he said, paid a penny where the Queen paid
a shilling. &#8216;The gentlemen,&#8217; he adds significantly, &#8216;by their
own confession, never lived so civilly and able in diet, cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>ing,
and household, as at this day; marry! the poor churl
never so beggarly.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pale
sends
counsel to
London.</div>

<p>The Lords of the Pale, however, sent three lawyers to
London to plead their cause, and in the meantime refused to
commit themselves by arguing. The advocates selected were
men of family, and thoroughly acquainted with their views,
but not agreeable to Sidney. Barnaby Scurlock he allowed
to be a man of credit and influence, but he had lately indulged
in &#8216;undecent and undutiful speech;&#8217; he had made a fortune
as Attorney-General, but Sussex had dismissed him for negligence.
Richard Netterville was a seditious, mutinous person,
who sowed discord and promoted causes against the Government&mdash;in
fact, an agitator &#8216;who had bred more unquiet and
discontent among the people than any one man had done in
Ireland these many years.&#8217; As to Henry Burnell, Recorder
of Dublin, whom Fitzwilliam had formerly described as one
of the best spoken and most learned men in Ireland, but a
perverse Papist, Sidney could only wish he would mind his
practice at the Bar, which had made him rich, and not
meddle with her Majesty&#8217;s prerogative. He was, he says,
&#8216;the least unhonest of the three, and yet he trusted to see the
English Government withdrawn.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney&#8217;s
criticisms.</div>

<p>Sidney&#8217;s high prerogative doctrines somewhat warped his
mind. He condescended to say that Netterville was &#8216;son of
a second and mean Justice of one of the benches;&#8217; as if that
could possibly prejudice his advocacy. He praised the
Chancellor for acting as a partisan, though no doubt he was
fair enough about prices. &#8216;He hath in public places both
learnedly, discreetly, wisely, and stoutly dealt in the matter
of cess, and rather like a counsellor at the bar than a judge
on the bench.&#8217; After all this is very doubtful praise, though
Gerard was not acting in his judicial capacity.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">True bill
against the
cess.</div>

<p>Before their emissaries started for England, the gentlemen
of the Pale procured a bill to be brought before a
Meath grand jury, of which the first clause contains these
words: &#8216;We find Sir Henry Sidney, Lord Deputy of her
Majesty&#8217;s realm of Ireland, Sir Lucas Dillon, &amp;c. (all the
council), ... gave commission to Thomas Cusack of Gerardiston,
sheriff of Meath, to charge ... cess ... corn, beef,
butter, &amp;c., and carts and carriages ... 1,800<i>l.</i> or thereabouts
... said sheriff has levied.... Sir Robert Tressilian,
Chief Justice of England, was put to death for misconstruing
the laws in Richard&#8217;s time.&#8217; Further clauses indict the
inferior ministers occupied about the cess. By advice of the
presiding judge, the charge against the officers of State was
erased, but the rest of the Bill was presented and justified,
and Burnell said openly in the Court of Star Chamber that
he would have carried the case through, but that it would
have delayed his journey to England.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature of
the tax.</div>

<p>The details of the question at issue between Sidney and
the Lords of the Pale are extremely obscure, and for a variety
of reasons. Thus, when they complained that the exaction
amounted to 9<i>l.</i> per ploughland, he offered to take 3<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,
but they refused, ostensibly from unwillingness to burden
their heirs. One explanation is that the ploughland was a
very uncertain measure, though generally reckoned at 120
Irish acres, and that the acreage had always been very much
understated. It was feared that Sidney would measure the
land more carefully and reduce the ploughlands to a uniform
size, thus extracting much more money than might be supposed
from his apparently liberal offer. Many lands had
been exempted by favour or custom, and such exemptions
tended to multiply; it was feared that Sidney might extinguish
them. Grass lands had perhaps not been taxed at
all, for Sidney only allowed 700 ploughlands in Meath, Westmeath,
Kildare, and Dublin. The surface of those counties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
without including Wicklow, contains nearly 11,000 ploughlands
of 120 Irish acres each. On inquiry, Sidney found
that the charge at existing prices came nearly to 8<i>l.</i> a ploughland,
&#8216;for ease of which, by making the burden to be borne
more universally, I by proclamation dissolved all freedoms
that had not had their continuance time out of memory of
man, whereof there were many, the most by a statute pretending
thereby an increase of military men, which God
knoweth, and I, are of little worth, ... the statute is expired.&#8217;
Many repined, but &#8216;it was proved that they had no
real reason to do so.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Netterville and his colleagues admitted that 1<i>s.</i> per acre
Irish, or 8<i>d.</i> sterling, was the rent of land &#8216;in most, or at
least in many places,&#8217; within the Pale. They allowed that a
foot soldier could not live on 8<i>d.</i> a day, nor a horseman on
9<i>d.</i>, and they said roundly that there was no way but to increase
these sums, declaring, and we may well believe declaring
truly, that the Queen already lost more by the jobbing
consequent on insufficient pay than she could lose by giving
the extra 1<i>d.</i> a day, which the soldiers asked for. That so
small an increase would content them reasonably they inferred
from the fact that it had often been accepted by them
in lieu of cess. The Pale was willing to victual soldiers
maintained for its defence, provided a fair price was paid for
it, Netterville and his colleagues pledging themselves to use
all their influence to obtain the Queen supplies if only she
would seek them constitutionally from Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>On the arrival of the three Irish lawyers in London,
Walsingham assured Sidney that nothing should be done to
prejudice his authority. The Privy Council received the
strangers coldly, and Leicester took occasion to &#8216;ruffle that
seditious knave Netterville&#8217; in a style which pleased his
brother-in-law greatly. The contention that cess was altogether
illegal did not recommend itself to the Queen or her
Ministers. Kildare and Ormonde, Gormanston and Dunsany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
were in London, and being called before the Council admitted
that the cess was customary, and only begged that consideration
might be showed to the Pale in time of scarcity. The
triumvirate, as Waterhouse calls them, were accordingly committed
close prisoners to the Fleet, and Sidney was gently
cautioned to shear his sheep and not to flay them. He confessed,
indeed, that he &#8216;held a straighter hand in the matter
of cess, the rather to bring them to a certain rent for the
release of the same.&#8217; Netterville had seen this clearly
enough, and therefore the Lord Deputy writes him down
&#8216;as seditious a varlet and as great an impugner of English
government as any Ireland beareth.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The chiefs
of the Pale
under arrest.</div>

<p>In all official letters from the Queen and the Privy Council
much indignation was expressed at the idea of the royal
prerogative being called in question. Sidney was instructed
to deal sharply with the gentlemen who had deputed Netterville
and his colleagues, and stiffly to assert the principle of
the cess. Failing, after repeated arguments, to yield the
point at issue until the result of their agents&#8217; mission was
known, and standing in the meantime on high constitutional
ground, Lords Baltinglass, Delvin, Trimleston, and Howth,
with many others of the best gentlemen in the Pale, were
committed to the castle. This was strictly in accordance
with the Queen&#8217;s orders, but in writing directly to
Sidney she reprimanded him for choosing so bad a time to
raise the question of the cess, and for drawing an inconvenient
amount of public attention to undeniable grievances. At
Court Philip Sidney accused Ormonde of thwarting his
father, and contemptuously held his tongue when the Earl
addressed him. Ormonde refused to quarrel, saying magnanimously
that the young man was bound to take his father&#8217;s
part, and that he was endowed with many virtues. Indeed,
nothing could be said against Ormonde but that he was a
general defender of the Irish cause, like all the rest of his
countrymen at Court. He hated Leicester and did not like
Sidney; but, as the latter himself expressed it, &#8216;love and loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
offices&#8217; are matters of favour, not of justice. How little
sympathy there was between them may be judged from the
passage in which the Lord Deputy defends himself against
the Queen&#8217;s private strictures on his conduct. &#8216;I am condemned,
I find,&#8217; he writes to Leicester, &#8216;for lack of policy, in
that in this broken time, and dread of foreign invasion, I
should commit such personages as I detain in the castle....
While I am in office I ought to be credited as soon as another;
and this is my opinion, if James Fitzmaurice were to land to-morrow,
I had rather a good many of them now in the castle
should still remain than be abroad.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Composition
for
cess.</div>

<p>The envoys, after tasting the hospitalities of the Tower, submitted
humbly enough in form, but did not abandon their case,
and the Queen, though she spoke boldly about prerogative, had
evidently some sympathy with them. The prisoners in Dublin
also submitted, and the Crown, having thus saved its credit,
a composition was arrived at, which seems to have been substantially
Burnell&#8217;s work, and to which Ormonde, Kildare, and
Dunsany, who were in London, gave a preliminary adhesion.
The counties of Dublin, Meath, Westmeath, Louth, Kildare,
Carlow, Wexford, and Kilkenny acknowledged themselves
bound to victual as many of the 1,000 soldiers and officers as
the Lord Deputy should appoint, and to pay 1<i>d.</i> a day for each
man of that number whether present or no, deducting that sum
in the case of those men whom they were required to victual
fully. They were to furnish 9,000 pecks of oats to the horsemen
at 10<i>d.</i> sterling, and to sell fresh provisions to the Lord
Deputy at reasonable prices for ready money. The Queen
consented thoroughly to repair the old store-houses, but not
to build new ones, and no other charge of any kind was to
be made against her, except for damage by sea or fire; but
she promised that purveyors should be punished if they
abused their power. To this arrangement the cess-payers
submitted with a tolerable grace, but officials complained that
the Queen had made a very bad bargain.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">LAST YEARS OF SIDNEY&#8217;S ADMINISTRATION, 1577 and 1578.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Chancellor
Gerard on
the Pale.</div>

<p>The letters of Lord Chancellor Gerard give a vivid picture
of the state of the Pale during the controversy about cess.
He divides the inhabitants into three classes&mdash;gentlemen,
idlemen, and churls. Every gentleman kept a number of
idle hangers-on, who sponged upon the poor cultivators, and
robbed openly when refused free quarters. Their nominal
master gave them neither food nor clothes but merely countenance,
in return for which they were always ready to avenge
his real or fancied injuries. These locusts ate up all the
scanty surplus which was left to the poor cultivator. Remonstrance
was vain, and perhaps the landowners had really
not much choice. &#8216;I will not put away my thieves,&#8217; a gentleman
would argue, &#8216;for then such a one&#8217;s thieves would rob
me; let him put away his, and I will put away mine.&#8217; The
vicious circle was hard to break, for the Government was not
strong or steady enough to repress all impartially. The
judges went circuit with little effect, for the juries &#8216;more
regard whether any of the parties are of kin or allied to the
justice or of the sept of the justice, or counsellor, than to the
matter, and that way commonly passeth the verdict.&#8217; Nor
was there much outward magnificence to hide the inherent
defects in such a judicial system. At Trim the Court of
Assize was like an English cattle-pen; there was no crier,
no trumpeters or javelin-men to hedge the sheriff&#8217;s dignity,
and no competent officer to see that indictments were properly
drawn or prisoners duly arraigned. That a desire
for justice existed was shown by the conduct of a Meath
grand jury, whose members were of very humble position, but
who took heart at the Chancellor&#8217;s visit, and, believing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
right would at last be done, found bills against above 100 of
the local oppressors for retaining idle followers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gerard&#8217;s
scheme for
governing
Ireland.</div>

<p>Important causes, in Gerard&#8217;s opinion, were better removed
into the Chancery or Star Chamber, but the thieves
might be dealt with by the hangman provided the assizes
were a little better conducted. English judges were much
wanted to secure something like impartiality. Gerard had
sixteen years&#8217; Welsh experience, and he saw no reason why
the policy which had succeeded there should not succeed in
Ireland. The Lord Deputy should endeavour to keep the
Irish from actual rebellion, and to persuade them to make
some contribution to the revenue. Afterwards, on the
borders of each county, English judges might &#8216;deliver justice
with such severity as the poor fleas may have yearly comfort
to be delivered from the webs and oppression of the great
spiders, ... and so by little and little to stretch the Pale
further, thereby to hit the mark long shot at, and hitherto
missed, which is to save the revenue of England and bring
somewhat from hence.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish to
be civilised
or extirpated.</div>

<p>Hitherto the prevailing policy had been to keep English
and Irish from hurting each other, and the more successful
it had been the more harm it had done. The peasants of the
Pale were all Irish. They propagated their species with
perfect recklessness, and it was therefore useless to expect
any increased civilisation. Even in Dublin people of English
race delighted in talking Irish, and habits and feelings always
followed the language. It might be possible to civilise some
of the Irish: the rest should be extirpated, and English
farmers with good leases and moderate rents substituted for
them. From this nucleus the Celtic wilderness might be
gradually reclaimed. In the meantime, the prisons were
few and insecure. There were no pounds. The mountains
everywhere harboured thieves, and they came within four
miles of Dublin. Cattle were not safe in the fields, even at
the very gates. But it had once been no better in Montgomery
and Radnor, in Brecknock and Monmouth. There
also it had been necessary to fold the flocks securely at night
until the twenty-sixth year of Henry VIII., when Wales was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
fully reduced to shire ground and the Presidency Court made
a reality by hanging the mountain thieves instead of allowing
the Lord Marchers to traffic in pardons. Dublin county
might be made as quiet as Monmouthshire if compositions for
crimes were sternly abolished and if successive Lord Deputies
would &#8216;work hanging instead of agreeing to recompense
felonious offences.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Drury&#8217;s
opinions.</div>

<p>White, the Master of the Rolls, who hated Sidney and
did not like English officials generally, and who ostentatiously
put his trust in Burghley rather than in Walsingham,
reported that Munster was quiet, but that the Lord President
gained little love by burdening the people with cess. Drury
argued that this quiet was owing entirely to the just severity
with which he ruled, having, as he oddly expresses it, executed
&#8216;divers malefactors of good account.&#8217; As for the cess, money
must be had somehow, for he had been forced to spend largely
on the repair of Limerick Castle. Cork was without stores,
and a foreign invasion might be expected at any moment;
for the intrigues of James Fitzmaurice were no secret. Lord
Barry compounded for an annual payment of 150<i>l.</i>, and
MacCarthy Reagh for 250<i>l.</i>, but in many cases no agreement
could be come to, and the uncertainty of all titles made
financial reform almost desperate. Rents were as uncertain
as titles, and landlords and tenants distrusted each other profoundly.
But firmness had its usual effect, and the stout old
soldier saw signs of increasing conformity among his subjects
of all ranks.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
offers to
submit,
1577.</div>

<p>Desmond, the common oppressor of all, complained loudly
that the soldiers ill-treated his tenants, and exacted cess, both
in money and in kind; that he and his were much the poorer,
and that the Queen was never a penny the richer. This complaint
was made directly to Burghley without complaining to
the Lord President, a breach of decorum for which the Earl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
received a rebuke. The English Council with becoming
gravity told Drury to make strict inquiry, but they knew, and
every officer in Ireland knew, that ill-paid soldiers could not
be kept in proper order. A loan of 500<i>l.</i> for the Munster
service was refused by the Queen, and the President warned
her that she would be put to greater expense by her refusal.
He begged for a galley to cruise on the coast, and like the
stout-hearted man he was he went on doing his best with
scanty means and not very much thanks. Sir John of
Desmond, being suspected of complicity with the Connaught
rebels, was arrested, whereupon the Earl retired into Kerry,
refused to go to the Deputy or President, ordered his dependents
to pay no taxes, and collected a force which soon swelled
to 1,000 men; professing all the time to consider his own
life in danger. Sir James, with 200 foot and some horse,
levied contributions in Duhallow, while Drury, besides his
own servants, had but 100 available troopers. The summer
passed away thus, and the winter was half over before
Desmond made up his mind that he was in no danger. He
agreed to disperse all his forces except twenty horsemen, and to
pay something towards the expenses of the province. Having
several times refused to come to the President, he came to
Kilkenny at Sidney&#8217;s first summons, was reconciled to Drury,
with whom he had not been on speaking terms, and promised
to support him as the Queen&#8217;s chief officer should be supported.
Sidney knew his mistress, and he advised the acceptance of
these terms. Drury was forced to submit, very much against
his own judgment; for Desmond, in his view, was the one
great obstacle to law and order. The habit, he said, of easily
pardoning great offenders, &#8216;which both now and heretofore
being used hath been the common gall to the good government
of the province, and the greatest encouragement that
may be to such as transgress, ... which kind of <i>precarium
imperium</i> is in my judgment the unfittest way to a perfect
reformation.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Drury&#8217;s
efforts to
divide
Munster
from Connaught.</div>

<p>That there had been intrigues between the Desmonds and
the Connaught rebels was probably true enough. An alliance
was even contemplated between Lady Mary Burke and Sir
John of Desmond. Both were already married, but matrimonial
ties were lightly regarded in the Clanricarde family,
and Sir John was not the man to let principle stand in the way
of interest. By keeping the Government constantly occupied
the Western gentlemen hoped to prevent administrative
reform, and there was always the off chance of a foreign invasion,
which might restore their waning importance. Religion
went for something, but probably not yet for much.
In order to cut off communications between Connaught and
Munster, Drury paid particular attention to Thomond, where
the Earl, a vain and vacillating man, who could do little harm
and might be of some use, made loyal professions, and received
nearly all the privileges he asked for, though he afterwards
complained that a new tax was nevertheless imposed on his
country. His experience of foreign Courts had not been so
pleasant as to tempt him to fresh adventures. Very different
treatment was awarded to Murrough O&#8217;Brien, noted as the
best horseman in Ireland, a great favourite with Desmond
and other disorderly persons, and proportionately feared by
the lovers of peace. He had been engaged in Fitzmaurice&#8217;s
old rebellion, and was suspected of plotting a new one. His
outrages were many, and a verdict was easily obtained at
Limerick. &#8216;300<i>l.</i> was offered for his life, and more would
have been given, but 3,000<i>l.</i> should not have saved him; ... his
death was far better than his life, and he confessed
he had deserved death.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Maltby
punishes
the Clanricarde
rebels.
His
opinion.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Great
severities.</div>

<p>While Drury was occupied, Maltby, much to Sidney&#8217;s
satisfaction, had taken up the military command of Connaught.
Clanricarde was already a prisoner; O&#8217;Connor Roe
yielded at the first summons; and there were only the Earl&#8217;s
two sons to deal with. They were given eight days to con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>sider
whether they would submit absolutely or no. When
that time had elapsed they asked for further delay, which
Maltby granted, partly because his own preparations were not
made. The rebels made loyal professions, &#8216;taking God to
witness that they had no intent to do anything more that
should purchase her Majesty&#8217;s further indignation.&#8217; This was
done only to put the Governor off his guard, and a treacherous
attack was made on one of his detachments, in which
a few men were killed and two officers captured. The rest
escaped to the castles of some well-affected gentlemen, and
Maltby lost no time in entering the mountains. John
Burke&#8217;s district was the first attacked. All houses and corn
were burned, and every human being the soldiers met was
killed. &#8216;I spared,&#8217; says Maltby, &#8216;neither old nor young.&#8217;
Ulick&#8217;s district was then visited, and a strong castle reduced
after two days&#8217; sap. &#8216;I put them to the misericordia of the
soldiers, who had lost their lieutenant. They were all slain
to the number of twenty-two, all tall men, who were at
the murder of the horsemen.&#8217; Another fruitless attempt
was then made at negotiation, but Maltby saw the object
was to gain time, and Ulick&#8217;s followers were treated like
John&#8217;s. Everything that would burn was burned, both in
plain and mountain, and every person met with was killed.
Protection for five weeks was afterwards granted that the
crops might be sown; how seed was obtained it is not easy
to understand. After this tremendous lesson Connaught was
quiet, and Maltby was free for a time to practise the Roman
theory of government as expounded by Virgil. By Sidney&#8217;s
order he had a conference with Drury, and they agreed that
with a little trouble the two provinces, &#8216;being ragged
countries as we found them,&#8217; might be brought into order.
The greatest obstacle was the uncertainty prevailing as to
Clanricarde&#8217;s fate, and it was evident that John Burke would
break out again whenever he had the power. In the meantime
strict military discipline was maintained, and Maltby
found that his soldiers, who were chiefly Irishmen and but lately
open enemies, became nearly as good as a general could
desire. &#8216;Travail, industry, and plain-dealing,&#8217; he said, &#8216;doth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
prevail over the people.... He that will not hazard some
limbs in these services or that standeth doubtful of everything
shall prevail little in this land.... To do good
among this rude nation they must be applied well, and plausible
dealing doth prevail much in some of them and in
others rigour doth no hurt, so as every of them must be
used in their conditions. They be a people that do now seek
much unto the administration of justice, and do greatly seem
to covet it, which God willing they shall not want with the
best advice I can give them. They are grown into a great
good liking of the Government, and do use more familiarity
towards us than they were wont to do, for commonly I do
never stay any of them that cometh unto me, be he good or
bad, but such of them as are taken by the officers if they be
found faulty to cast off the same; and few of them do escape
my hands. The rest do very well allow of it.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rory Oge
O&#8217;More,
1571 to
1578.</div>

<p>During his last term of office Sidney had much trouble
with Rory Oge O&#8217;More, who still claimed the ancient
chiefry of Leix. In 1571 and 1572 Rory had been at the
head of a band which fluctuated between 80 and 240 swords,
and had succeeded in defying all Fitzwilliam&#8217;s efforts.
Arrangements were made to surround him. Kildare and
Ormonde were commissioned to hunt him with all their
forces, and the latter delayed a journey to England rather
than leave the task unfinished. O&#8217;More was brought to make
a formal and somewhat humble submission and to give
hostages, of which Feagh MacHugh O&#8217;Byrne was one; but
Fitzwilliam, who knew Ireland too well to be sanguine, was
of opinion that the hanging of a pledge or two would not
prevent Irishmen from breaking out whenever it happened to
suit them. Rory was spoiling the Pale again within four
months, and in the spring of 1573 the Lord Deputy pronounced
him worse than ever. He submitted again the
same year, and a few days afterwards gave important help to
Desmond in his escape from Dublin. When that turbulent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
personage found himself safe in Munster, Rory Oge was one
of the outlaws whom he adjured to stand firm. Kildare was
also accused of plotting with him, and this charge was never
fully cleared up.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rory Oge
submits,</div>

<p>The arrival of Sidney in Ireland was always understood
by the Irish as a sign of what modern politicians call vigour,
and Rory Oge, among others, thought it wise to make his
peace. &#8216;He came unto me,&#8217; wrote Sidney, &#8216;on the Earl of
Ormonde&#8217;s word, and in the cathedral of Kilkenny submitted
himself, repenting (as he said) his former faults, and promising
hereafter to live in better sort (for worse than he
hath been he cannot be), for by him and his the greatest
spoil and disorders have been committed upon the Queen&#8217;s
County and the Pale. I accepted him upon treaty, and trial
of amendment till my return.... I have given him warning,
and will keep touch with him if I can.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">but soon
breaks out
again, and
burns Naas,
1576.</div>

<p>For a year or more Rory seems to have kept pretty quiet;
but the rumour of a Spanish invasion and the exhortations of
John Burke were too much for his prudence, and the dispute
about the cess laid the Pale unusually open to attack. Allying
himself as of old with Connor MacCormac, who stood in
the same relation to the remnant of the O&#8217;Connors as he himself
did to the O&#8217;Mores, he was soon at the head of 140 men
and boys. On the night of March 3, 1577, Rory and his
ally brought their band to Naas, and entered the town, which
they found unprepared. Their men had no muskets, but
were armed with torches stuck upon long poles, with which,
&#8216;like hags and furies of hell,&#8217; they rushed through the street,
setting fire to the low thatched houses on either side; and they
were gone again within half an hour. The night was windy,
the March weather had dried the thatch, and the whole place
was burned to the ground in a few minutes. &#8216;There were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>&#8217;
says Sidney, &#8216;about 500 men&#8217;s bodies in the town, manlike
enough in appearance, but neither manful nor wakeful, for
they confess they were all asleep in their beds after they had
filled themselves and surfeited upon Patron Day, which
day is celebrated for the most part of the people of this
country birth with gluttony and idolatry as far as they dare.
They had neither watch nor gate shut; ... the town is
open on all sides, and without soldiers, yet how unwilling to
bear any charge for their own defence.&#8217; Rory Oge, says
Hooker, &#8216;tarried very little in the town saving that he sat a
little while upon the cross in the market-place,&#8217; and feasted his
eyes with the flames. None of the townsmen were killed.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>After this exploit Rory&#8217;s force increased rapidly, and he
attacked Leighlin Bridge, of which Sir Peter Carew the
younger was constable, but which was actually in charge of
his famous brother George, who here performed his first noteworthy
service. Half the town was already burned when
Carew, at the head of only seven horsemen and five musketeers,
boldly sallied out against the enemy, who were between 200
and 300. Surprised in the darkness, they fled, but soon
recovered, and some of them actually entered the castle.
Carew managed to shut the gates, and his assailants, having
suffered considerably, departed without doing any further
harm. The Devonshire captain lost only two soldiers and
one horse, but not a single one of his men escaped unwounded.
Soon after this Captain Harrington and Alexander Cosby,
son of the Captain of Leix, were taken prisoners, treacherously
enough, according to the English accounts, by Rory, and
carried about by him in triumph. If Cosby was, as some
accounts say, an actor in the Mullaghmast tragedy, he deserved
nothing better, but in this kind of warfare it is to be feared
that breaches of faith were common enough on both sides.
All attempts to catch Rory had hitherto been vain, and
Sidney was forced to temporise for the sake of the prisoners.
Robert Hartpole, who was used to this kind of service, and
who had probably many friends among the country people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
brought fifty soldiers to a cabin at the side of a wood, where
he heard that the outlaw and his prisoners were to sleep.
Finding himself in a trap, Rory tried to kill Harrington by
slashing at him with his sword. He fractured his skull,
broke his arm, and cut off one of his fingers; but Harrington
recovered from these and other injuries. Rory had his shirt
cut off by a sword, but managed to creep away between the
soldiers&#8217; legs, and reached the covert with a single companion.
The cabin was on the very edge of the bush. The prisoners
were rescued, and sixteen people, including all the men in
the house, were killed. Rory&#8217;s wife was also killed, but one
woman at least, a sister of Feagh MacHugh, was spared.
Connor MacCormac was perhaps not present, for he afterwards
made his peace with the Government and received a pension.
Letters implicating John Burke and others were found in the
house.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney in
Kilkenny
and
Tipperary.</div>

<p>Harrington&#8217;s capture gave much encouragement to discontented
persons, and the Lord Deputy determined, as he
expressed it, to attempt Rory&#8217;s suppression by plaguing his
maintainers. He went to Kilkenny on Christmas Eve, accompanied
only by Sir Lucas Dillon, and found, as he expected,
that the rebel had plenty of friends high and low in the town.
The time from Christmas to Twelfth Day was spent in investigating
the matter, and so abundant was the evidence
that it would have taken till Easter to hear it all. Tipperary
enjoyed comparative immunity from the operations of Government,
and Rory Oge&#8217;s children were fostered among
Ormonde&#8217;s principal tenants and officers. Fulke Grace, the
Earl&#8217;s constable at Roscrea, had refused to let Drury enter
the castle until he had promised him protection, and he now
refused to come to Sidney himself when sent for. All this
and a great deal more was sworn to, but &#8216;such partiality and
affectionate dealing were found in the juries, as were the
matter never so plain, the evidence never so full, if it touched
any of their friends, and namely, the tenants and servants of
the Earl of Ormonde, no indictment would be found&mdash;no,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
though the party made submission and confessed the fault;
if the matter touched any of Ossory, were the evidence never
so weak, the jury would find it.&#8217; The jurors were bound to
appear before the Star Chamber, and the Lord Deputy returned
to Dublin without catching Rory Oge.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rory is
killed by
the Fitzpatricks,
1578.</div>

<p>After his narrow escape, Rory was soon at the head of a
band, and burning villages as busily as ever. He entered
Carlow through one of many breaches in the wall, and fired
all the thatched houses, but in retiring he was attacked by
Cosby or Hartpole at a ford, and suffered great loss. But
here again he himself escaped, so that even Sidney thought
he bore a charmed life and talked of &#8216;sorcery or enchantment
(if it be lawful so to deem).&#8217; In the end the fatal snare was
of his own laying. In order to entrap the Baron of Upper
Ossory he sent a spy to tell him, as if of his own accord, that
Rory had gathered a great spoil of &#8216;pots, pans, pewter,
nappery, linen, and other household stuff and implements&#8217;&mdash;a
strange bait for King Edward&#8217;s old playfellow&mdash;and that it
might all be easily seized. The emissary was instructed to
insist on a small force only being sent: a larger one would
attract attention and defeat the scheme. The Baron hardly
knew what to believe, but decided not to lose the chance.
He brought a strong force to the appointed place, but kept
aloof himself with the main body, and sent about thirty men
into the wood. Rory also kept back the bulk of his followers,
but showed himself, under the impression that the Fitzpatricks
would not face so renowned a champion; &#8216;wherein,&#8217;
says Sidney, &#8216;he found himself very much deceived.&#8217; The
Baron&#8217;s kerne set upon him stoutly, and he fell pierced by many
mortal wounds. His brother-in-law, Feagh MacHugh, swore
to avenge him, and kept his word. Maltby called Rory the
Robin Hood of Ireland, and the Queen&#8217;s approbation was conveyed
to Lord Upper Ossory. Rory&#8217;s followers carried off his
body, but the head was afterwards sent to Sidney and duly
set up on Dublin Castle&mdash;the Lord Deputy afterwards complaining
bitterly that the Queen made light of the service,
being persuaded that it was as easy to kill such a rogue as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>

&#8216;that there was not in Erin a greater destroyer against
foreigners than that man; and he was a very great loss.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Government
of
Drury.</div>

<p>Drury, being relieved for a moment from danger on the
side of Desmond, was able to turn his attention to the disturbers
of Leinster. At Limerick he hanged Rory Oge&#8217;s
Brehon, who was much esteemed among the people; for the
President it was enough that he practised only such law as
was repugnant to her Majesty. One of Rory&#8217;s sons, accompanied
by his nurse, was taken in a wood near Roscrea.
Drury also found time for a not inconsiderable number of
hangings, and reported with complacency that 400 had been
executed by justice and martial law since he took office. At
Clonmel a man was pressed to death. A sharp eye was kept
on all arrivals from abroad, and a friar, fresh from Portugal,
was hanged in his cowl at Limerick. The President was able
to say that he had been the first to appoint English sheriffs
in Thomond and Desmond. Justice, in his opinion, was liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
by the people, and her Majesty&#8217;s revenues were much increased
thereby.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
finds
Sidney too
expensive.</div>

<p>The affairs of the Netherlands had now become pressingly
important, and Queen Elizabeth was forced to provide material
help for the patriotic party. Scarcely had she made
up her mind to back their bills to the extent of 100,000<i>l.</i> and
to send 6,000 men to the provinces, than the victory gained
at Gemblours by Don John of Austria, or rather by Alexander
Farnese, seemed for a moment to place William of Orange
in a desperate position. The Queen saw that her help would
really be wanted, and war, even clandestine war, required a
great deal of money. Sidney was not a cheap Lord Deputy,
and there were plenty of people at Court to tell the Queen
that he had exceeded the 20,000<i>l.</i> which had been mentioned
as the annual expense of his government. Ormonde was at
Elizabeth&#8217;s side, and Ormonde&#8217;s influence was always directed
against Leicester and his brother-in-law. It was at first
proposed to recall the Lord Deputy in a peremptory manner.
But Walsingham and Wilson, and probably Burghley also,
worked in Sidney&#8217;s interest, and Elizabeth&#8217;s better nature
prevailed over her love of money and her ill-temper towards
a faithful servant who treated her somewhat too like an equal.
It was suggested that Sidney should be left alone until he
himself asked to be relieved, and then for a time judgment
was suspended until Lord Chancellor Gerard should be heard
on the question of cess and on the state of Ireland generally.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Philip
Sidney&#8217;s
advice to
his father.</div>

<p>At last the Queen made up her mind that, whatever might
be done by another Deputy, the present one would never
consent to govern as cheaply as she wished. Walsingham
privately informed Sidney that he was to be recalled, but that
to save his credit he would be summoned as if for a short
visit to Court for the purpose of explaining accounts and other
knotty matters. The wily secretary advised his friend to
put his affairs in order as soon as possible, and to be ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
for any emergency. At last the summons was sent. The
Queen announced that proposals for a more economical establishment
had been made to her, and that before giving her
decision she wished to see the Deputy, who was to bring with
him the auditor and his books. Five thousand pounds were
sent to keep things going until Midsummer, and out of this
Sidney was to pay the soldiers. This letter, which ordered
the Lord Deputy to be at Court by May 10, was more than
a month on the road, and did not reach Dublin till April 23.
Literal compliance was therefore impossible, and the advice
which Sidney received from his son was not to leave Ireland
till Michaelmas, so that his enemies might not have to say
that they had driven him away. &#8216;Your lordship is to write
back,&#8217; said the young diplomatist, &#8216;not as though you desired
to tarry, but only showing that unwillingly you must
employ some days thereabouts; and if it please you to add
that the Chancellor&#8217;s presence shall be requisite.... and
then the more time passes the better it will be blown
over.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney&#8217;s
last days in
Ireland.</div>

<p>Sidney took the advice of his famous son, delaying his
return till September, but sending over Waterhouse at once
with such instructions as were likely to smooth his path.
The Queen was reminded that the cess question was not yet
fully settled, that the auditor&#8217;s books could not be posted in
a minute, that a foreign invasion was at hand, that there
were many unfinished causes scarcely fit to be entrusted to a
new hand, and that her Majesty owed her Deputy 3,000<i>l.</i>,
for which he held the Treasurer&#8217;s warrant. If anything
could make Elizabeth acquiesce in the neglect of her orders
it was an allusion to the 3,000<i>l.</i>, and she allowed Sidney to
stay where he was until he had an opportunity of conferring
with Gerard. Sir William Drury was nominated Lord
Justice to take up the government as soon as it should be
vacant. Rory Oge was disposed of soon after this, and a
branch of the Scottish MacDonnells, long settled at Tinnakill,
in the Queen&#8217;s County, received a pension of 300<i>l.</i> a year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
in consideration of giving the Queen constant service as
gallowglass. In the meantime the MacMahons had broken
out, and driven off cattle from the Northern frontier of the
Pale. Lord Louth followed with a few horsemen, and falling
into an ambuscade was himself slain, as well as the eldest son
of the loyal Sir Hugh Magennis. The loss of an active and
thoroughly well-affected young lord of twenty-three could
not be passed over, and Sidney invaded Monaghan, destroying
everything that he could lay hands on. MacMahon came to
Newry with a withe about his neck and sued for pardon; but
Sidney had by that time left Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">He leaves
Ireland
finally.</div>

<p>Gerard was detained in Wales by illness, and Sidney sent
first Attorney-General Snagg, and afterwards Ludovic Briskett,
Clerk of the Council, to keep his cause alive at Court.
Men, money, victuals, and munition were required, for there
was talk of a descent by Stukeley, and the Lord Deputy
wished to hold a Parliament to renew the subsidy of 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
on each ploughland which had expired, and to renew the
Act imposing a duty on wines, which was about to expire.
But all eyes and ears were now turned to the Netherlands,
and Waterhouse wrote to warn Sidney that he would get
nothing except perhaps ammunition, and that the money last
sent was regretted. &#8216;Irish alarms,&#8217; he said, &#8216;are so far from
waking courtiers out of their sleep that, as I am sure, till
they hear that the enemy is landed, they will never think
of aid that may carry with it extraordinary charge. There is
now no speech of the return of the Earls of Ormonde and
Kildare.... The States have made John Norris general, &amp;c.&#8217;
Thus matters stood when the Irish Chancellor arrived in
Dublin; and no time was then lost in completing the
arrangements about cess. An assembly of notables was convened
from Dublin, Meath, Louth, Kildare, King&#8217;s and
Queen&#8217;s Counties, Carlow, Wexford, Kilkenny, and Tipperary,
and the agreement already referred to was thus made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
Sidney at this time took a strong dislike to Gerard, whom he
accused of ambitious dealing and of plotting against him at
Court. &#8216;He did not let to say that he had brought over such
warrants for himself and restraint for me as I could do nothing
without him,&#8217; and he was accused of boasting that
Ireland should be governed with a white rod when Drury
ruled by his direction.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His
character.</div>

<p>At eight o&#8217;clock on the evening of September 12, exactly
three years after his arrival, Sidney embarked at Wood Quay,
and when on board his vessel surrendered the sword to
Gerard, and finally severed his connection with Ireland. If
we except Strafford and Cromwell, he was perhaps the ablest
man who ever reigned in Dublin Castle, and there is a charm
about him which belongs to scarcely any one else even in the
Elizabethan age. Who shall say how much his famous son,
and scarcely less famous daughter, owed to a father whose
letters of advice remain as almost unapproachable models,
and whose life showed such a noble example? The official
correspondence of the time is full of allusions to his powers
of work, to the hours which he sat patiently through, and to
the confidence which his decisions commanded. Though
suffering from a painful disease, he shrank from no journey,
and the rapidity of his movements was extraordinary. Fortune,
ease, and health were given up to the public service,
and though he complained he never hesitated. &#8216;I had no
time,&#8217; he said, &#8216;to apply my mind to take physic in Ireland.&#8217;
He well knew the value of exercise and reasonable leisure, but
he denied himself both. As Elizabeth&#8217;s representative he
was accustomed to take a high line, and he sometimes dared
to maintain the dignity of the Crown even against the great
Queen who wore it. Her cousin Ormonde should not be
favoured in his causes except according to law. Mr. Christopher
Hatton should not have a license to export yarn in
defiance of an Irish Act of Parliament. If the Queen let fall
hasty words detrimental to the Irish service, her Viceroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
would rebuke her for being &#8216;so great an enemy to her own
profit.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His
relations
with the
Queen.</div>

<p>And thus it came to pass that while Elizabeth honoured,
and perhaps loved, the man in whose arms her brother
breathed his last, and whose wife had lost her looks and almost
her life in nursing her through the small-pox, she was not
sorry when an opportunity offered of wounding his masterful
spirit. When he seemed to bargain with her for the retention
of the Welsh Presidency as a condition of entering on
the hated Irish service, she rebuked him for daring to limit
her prerogative, and when he made a gay figure at Court
she said it was no wonder, for that he held two of her best
offices. But she took care to leave him both places, and
sometimes called him Harry. She grumbled at the expense
of his government, but in the end seldom refused to give him
nearly as much money as he asked for. He tells us that he
lost 9,000<i>l.</i> by his Irish service, which was an enormous sum
in those days, but Elizabeth, though she might never replace
money so spent, at least did not neglect his children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
personal
qualities.</div>

<p>Sidney was a ready speaker and a vigorous writer.
Campion professes to give one of his speeches, but about such
reports there must always be some doubts. The letters, however,
are there, and if Sidney spoke nearly as well as he
wrote, we can well believe that a great effect was sometimes
produced. His written style is full and vigorous, and gives
a much better idea of Elizabethan English than that of many
professed authors whose affectation of elegance only tended
to obscurity. Sidney was very fond of heraldry, and not a
little proud of his right to display the bear and ragged staff.
Indeed, he particularly impressed upon his sons the necessity
of living up to the standard of their mother&#8217;s family&mdash;a
family, as modern students cannot help observing, which
produced Edmund Dudley, Northumberland, and Leicester.
This was an amiable weakness; a certain irascibility was a
worse defect in a statesman, but his anger was soon appeased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
and there can be no doubt that he was personally very
popular. Among many virtues this defect was noted, that
he was too fond of the pleasures of the table, and among
Irish-speaking people the nickname of &#8216;big Henry of the
beer&#8217; was sometimes given to him. He was once accused of
flirting with a married woman, but this may have been only
gossip, and affection for her husband breathes in every line of
Lady Mary Sidney&#8217;s letters.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His
reception
at Court.</div>

<p>On his arrival at Court the late Lord Deputy was
received coolly, chiefly perhaps because foreign affairs engrossed
all attention. The lodgings assigned to him at
Hampton Court were insufficient. He was ill, and his wife
was ill, and yet no separate sitting-room could be found
for the man who had spent his health and fortune in the
thankless Irish service. Lord Chamberlain Sussex knew but
too well what that service was, but he was not likely to exert
himself much for Leicester&#8217;s brother-in-law. The latter,
indeed, was particularly weak at this time, for Simier had
spitefully told the Queen of his marriage with Lady Essex.
With a not uncommon inconsistency Elizabeth, though she had
decided not to marry her favourite, could not bear to resign
him to another, and talked about the Tower; but Sussex
dissuaded her, saying that no man was to be troubled for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
lawful marriage. In this the Lord Chamberlain showed
singular generosity, but Sidney could not expect much favour
from him. &#8216;When the worst is known,&#8217; said Lady Mary,
&#8216;old Lord Harry and his old Moll will do as well as they can
in parting like good friends the small portion allotted our
long service in Court, which as little as it is seems something
too much; ... in this case I am in it is not possible to be
in my chamber till after sunset, when the dear good lord
shall be, as best becomes him, lord of his own.&#8217;</p>

letter (undated) soon after, in the <i>Sidney Papers</i>. It is the <i>Book of Howth</i>
which accuses Sidney of being a &#8216;lusty feeder and surfeiter.&#8217; The Irish
nickname might very well come from some dispute with a contractor, and
not from Sidney&#8217;s fondness for malt liquor. Sidney died in 1586, prematurely
old, at fifty-seven years of age. In the British Museum a black letter
pamphlet contains a funeral sermon by Thomas White, D.D., the founder
of Sion College. The whole is interesting, more especially the following
passage: &#8216;He consumed himself in yielding light to other men; besides
his special gift of affability to poor and simple men, the very grace of all
his greatness. It is no hard matter for a man to be humble in low estate,
but to be lowly in greatness is not a common gift; and if pride herself be
often forced to dissemble humility, because lowliness maketh a simple man
to be highly commended, how much more doth it excel, when it shall indeed
appear in persons of value and renown! Wherefore if any man will build
his house high, let him lay his foundations very low, for envy shoots at
high marks, and pride goes before a fall.&#8217; Herein lay the secret of Sidney&#8217;s
immense popularity. His haughtiness was reserved for the great and
powerful.</p></div>

<span class="smaller">THE IRISH CHURCH DURING THE FIRST TWENTY YEARS OF
ELIZABETH&#8217;S REIGN.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
aims at
outward
uniformity.</div>

<p>Outward uniformity was what Elizabeth chiefly aimed at in
the first years of her reign, and before a Papal excommunication
forced her to be the enemy of all who adhered to Rome.
The Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity were passed as a
matter of course, but a clause in the latter statute shows that
there was every disposition to treat the Irish tenderly. Most
parts of Ireland, the Act declares, were devoid of English
ministers to read the Common Prayer and administer the
sacraments; &#8216;and for that also, that the same may not be in
their native language, as well for difficulty to get it printed,
as that few in the whole realm can read Irish letters,&#8217; it was
ordained that ministers and priests who knew no English
might do their office in Latin. It was a singularly ill-advised
plan, for the Jesuits and friars all knew Latin, and
the Irish people knew it even less than English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
English
Bible and
Prayer-book.
Images.</div>

<p>In Dublin, however, everyone spoke English, and the
Common Prayer Book of Edward VI. was used at the installation
of Sussex. Open opposition was impossible, but on the
following Sunday an attempt was made to discredit the new
ritual by a trick. Christ Church contained a marble Christ
with a crown of thorns on His head. This statue, which had
been removed by Browne and replaced by Curwen, was
observed to bleed during the service, and many were ready
to believe in a miracle. Sedgrave, the mayor, who had sat
quiet during the former service, produced a rosary and prayed
openly before the bloody effigy. A former monk of the
cathedral, named Leigh, cried out that Christ could not but
sweat blood since heresy had come into the Church. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
tumult seemed imminent, and Sussex and his suite hurried
out of the choir. But Curwen stood upon a bench and
showed the congregation that Leigh had placed a sponge
filled with blood within the crown of thorns. The Protestants
were triumphant, the Roman party confounded, and
Curwen&#8217;s orders to have the statue broken up were obeyed
without demur. Parker made good use of this occurrence to
persuade the Queen to have images removed from all the
churches. The exposure of so gross a fraud may have contributed
to secure outward conformity in Dublin; but among
the Irish-speaking people in the country it was perhaps
scarcely heard of. The counter-reformation was everywhere
in progress under teachers trained at Louvain. The actual
state of the question as between Crown and Pope may best
be arrived at by considering each diocese separately. A large
Bible presented by Archbishop Heath to one or both of the
Dublin cathedrals was eagerly read, and more than 7,000
copies are said to have been bought for the Irish market in
two years; but they can have been of little use to those who
did not know a word of English.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">See of
Armagh.
Adam
Loftus.</div>

<p>The primatial see of Armagh was vacant at the accession
of Elizabeth, and remained so until 1563. Sussex recommended
Adam Loftus, a Yorkshireman, who was already in
Ireland and distinguished as a preacher. Loftus, who was
educated at Cambridge, was the friend of Cartwright, and this
may have retarded his promotion for a time. In November,
1561, his preferment was announced, and almost immediately
afterwards the news was contradicted on authority. &#8216;I know
not,&#8217; said Sussex, &#8216;who hath informed that he is not worthy
of that place, but if a vehement zeal in religion, good understanding
in the Scriptures, doctrines, and other kinds of
learning, continual study, good conversation of life, and a
bountiful gift of God in utterance, be sufficient to enable him,
I undertake I have better ground to enable him than any
man of that land or this, of what vocation soever he be, hath
to disable him.&#8217; Loftus made the usual professions of un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>willingness,
and Sussex remarked that the primacy was great
in name, but the living very small. He had searched for three
years without finding a fit man. The Lord Deputy&#8217;s entreaties
prevailed, and in October 1561 a <i>congé d&#8217;élire</i> was
addressed to the Dean and Chapter of Armagh. This is remarkable,
because the necessity for such instruments in
Ireland had been already abolished by Act of Parliament.
The letter was sent down to Armagh, and the Dean replied
that no election was possible. The greater part of the
Chapter were &#8216;temporal men and Shane O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s horsemen.&#8217;
The appointment was accordingly made by patent. Perhaps
it had been the Queen&#8217;s intention to obtain only a permissive
dispensation. At all events, the failure of the first attempt
at capitular election was enough for her, and she did not
repeat the experiment. Loftus was consecrated by Archbishop
Curwen in March 1563, and the succession was thus
preserved, for Curwen&#8217;s authenticity has never been questioned
at Rome. At the beginning of 1565 Loftus was elected Dean
of St. Patrick&#8217;s, and was empowered to hold the deanery along
with his archbishopric, from which it must be allowed that
he derived little or no profit. It does not appear that he ever
saw his cathedral, which was burned by Shane O&#8217;Neill in
1566 lest it should shelter the English; and he was ready to
resign a dignity which brought him not more than 20<i>l.</i> a year.
&#8216;Of the whole revenues,&#8217; he said, &#8216;there remaineth nothing
but the bare house and fourscore acres of ground at Termonfeckin.
Though peace ensue the repressing of this rebel, yet
these wastes will not be inhabited, nor the spoils recovered
many years hereafter.&#8217; In the following year Loftus was
translated to Dublin and forced to resign his deanery, which
he did very unwillingly. Curwen, he said, had so impoverished
his see that it was worth only 400<i>l.</i> Irish with
1,200 acres of land, and he was &#8216;minded rather to continue
in the poor state&#8217; of nominal primate with St. Patrick&#8217;s
thrown in. He had, however, admitted that he could do no
good in the Northern see, &#8216;for that altogether it lieth among
the Irish.&#8217; Love of money was throughout the bane of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
Loftus, and went far to neutralise the good effects of his
learning and eloquence.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Loftus is
removed to
Dublin.</div>

<p>Having determined to remove Loftus to Dublin, the
Queen seriously thought of making the Dean, Terence
Daniel, Primate of All Ireland. He had been thought of in
1564, but was very unfit for the office, and the appointment,
which would have been avowedly political, was perhaps prevented
by Sidney or Parker. Loftus recommended his friend
Cartwright; but Thomas Lancaster, an Englishman who had
formerly been Bishop of Kildare, was preferred, and in consideration
of the state of his see was allowed to hold other
preferment both in England and Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Papal
primates.</div>

<p>But neither Loftus nor Lancaster was acknowledged at
Rome, and a Primate not acknowledged at Rome had small
chance of reverence from the Irish masses. Donat O&#8217;Teige
was provided by the Pope, and was at Armagh in the summer
of 1561, when Shane O&#8217;Neill made his first attempt to burn
the cathedral and its garrison of English soldiers. The pretended
&#8216;Papist Primate,&#8217; said Sussex, &#8216;sung mass with all
the friars. After mass the Primate and the friars went thrice
about Shane&#8217;s men, saying certain prayers, and willed them to
go forward, for God was on their side. Whereupon he and all
his men made a solemn vow and took their oaths never to turn
their faces from the church till they had burned it and all the
English churches, and so with a great shout set forward and
assaulted the churchyard, where divers of them quickly left
their bodies, and the rest, setting on fire the friars&#8217; house and
other old houses in another part of the town, ran away.&#8217; We
cannot wonder at the difficulty of obtaining canonical election
for Loftus. O&#8217;Teige died in the following year, and in 1564
Richard Creagh was provided in his room.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Archbishop
Creagh.
His sufferings.</div>

<p>If martyrdom consists in suffering for one&#8217;s opinions, few
men have earned the crown better than Archbishop Creagh.
He was a Limerick man, the son of a merchant, and himself
engaged in trade. A ship in which he was about to sail put
to sea while he was engaged in prayer. She foundered with
all hands, and this escape made Creagh more serious than ever.
He went to Louvain, and afterwards intended to enter
the severe Theatine order, which had been founded about
the time of his birth; but Pius IV., under pain &#8216;of cursing,&#8217;
obliged him to accept the Irish Primacy. During Queen
Mary&#8217;s life he had already refused the Archbishopric of
Cashel. From Rome he went by way of Augsburg to
Antwerp, and thence to Louvain, where, dressed in his archiepiscopal
robes, he gave a dinner to the doctors. He then
sailed in a ship bound for Ireland, was driven to Dover by a
contrary wind, and made his way to Rochester. &#8216;There,&#8217; says
his evidence before the Recorder of London, &#8216;he found an
Irish boy begging, whom he took with him to London, and
there lodged at the Three Cups in Broad Street, where he
tarried not past three days, and went to Paul&#8217;s Church, and
there walked but had no talk with any man, and so to Westminster
Church to see the monuments there, and from thence
came to Westminster Hall the same time that he heard say
Bonner was arraigned.&#8217; He made his way to Ireland, landed
in his own province, and went to a monastery to hear mass.
Immediately afterwards, and within an hour of setting foot on
dry land, he was arrested by soldiers and sent to England.
He was imprisoned and examined in the Tower, whence he
escaped after a few weeks. By some extraordinary negligence,
or possibly on purpose, all the doors were left open one morning.
Creagh passed out at the main gate and was stopped
by the Beefeaters, to whom he represented himself as the
servant of Bilson, a Roman Catholic priest who was undergoing
an easy imprisonment. He was allowed to go free,
and it is not surprising that he should have thought his
escape miraculous.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Fate of
Creagh.</div>

<p>Creagh made his way back to Ulster. According to his
own account he was at all times friendly to Englishmen,
anxious to serve the Queen as far as conscience would allow,
and careful to prevent Shane O&#8217;Neill from plundering the Pale
&#8216;according to his cursed custom.&#8217; No sincere priest&mdash;and
Creagh was undoubtedly a virtuous man&mdash;could have approved
Shane&#8217;s doings, and no Archbishop could be well pleased to
see his cathedral a blackened ruin. But his language in the
Tower differed greatly in tone from that which he held in
Ulster. On Christmas Day 1566 he was with Shane, and
wrote to Sidney suggesting that &#8216;if peace should be or not,
whether it should please your lordship, that we should have
our old service in our churches, and suffer the said churches
to be up for that use, so that the said Lord O&#8217;Neill should
the less destroy no more churches, and perhaps should help
to restore such as by his procurement were destroyed.&#8217; In
the same letter he admits that he had close relations with
Spain, and throughout uses the first person plural. Sidney&#8217;s
winter campaign, which broke Shane&#8217;s power, perhaps made
Ulster untenable, or that chief may not have been unwilling
to surrender him in order to make room for Terence Daniel.
However that may be, Creagh seems to have wandered into
Connaught, for it was by O&#8217;Shaughnessy that he was arrested,
just four months after his letter to Sidney. He was indicted
in Dublin for conspiring with Shane, but the intention to
try him there was abandoned. There may have been considerable
doubt of the fact, and much more of Irish judges
and juries; or perhaps Sidney disliked the odious task.
Once more Creagh escaped, but was again arrested by some of
Kildare&#8217;s people and sent to London. He was never put on
his trial, and remained eighteen years in the Tower. In
1579, after he had been more than eleven years in prison, one
Hupton, his keeper for the last five, who thought himself,
says Creagh, &#8216;ordained to take harm by Papists,&#8217; was in
custody &#8216;only for papistry.&#8217; Colwick, another keeper, was
accused of carrying letters to the poor Archbishop, but he
said he had never given him anything but certain sums of
20<i>s.</i>, 10<i>s.</i>, or 5<i>s.</i> at a time, &#8216;sent him by his countrymen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>&#8217;
In 1574 Creagh wrote a long letter to the Council, in which
he defended himself from all charges of treason or rebellion,
while acknowledging that he owed obedience to the Pope.
One of his legs, he said, was rendered useless by the pressure
of irons for eight years. He had lost most of his teeth, and
suffered from rupture, stone, &#8216;and many other like miseries.&#8217;
Yet he lived on till 1585. A memorandum made in the
spring of that year notes him as &#8216;a dangerous man to be
among the Irish, for the reverence that is by that nation
borne unto him, and therefore fit to be continued in prison.&#8217;
A few months afterwards he died. It has been said that
he was poisoned; but his manifold diseases would account
for his death, and Holing the Jesuit, a contemporary writer,
says simply that he was worn out by years and by the filth of
his prison. The story is bad enough as it stands.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

Bishop
Staples.</div>

<p>Edward Staples, who was appointed both by King and
Pope in 1529, was deprived in 1554, but remained in Ireland.
&#8216;I was,&#8217; he says, &#8216;driven almost to begging, thrust
out of my house, cast from estimation, and made a jesting
among monks and friars, nor any cause why was laid against
me; but for that I did marry a wife they did put an Irish
monk in my place, whose chief matter in preaching hath been
in railing against my old master.&#8217; Pole, he adds, chiefly
objected to his praying for Henry VIII.&#8217;s soul, but promised
that he should have some means of support. He was, however,
left to beg, and could not even afford the journey to
London. He probably died soon after Elizabeth&#8217;s accession,
for the Cistercian William Walsh was left in possession of his
see until 1560, when he was deprived for preaching against
the royal supremacy and the Book of Common Prayer.
Though appointed by Pole, Walsh received no regular Papal
provision till 1564. He was soon afterwards imprisoned, but
escaped to France in 1572. In 1575 he had a Brief to act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
both for Armagh and Dublin, Creagh being in the Tower
and the other primacy vacant; but it is not clear that he returned
to Ireland. &#8216;He is,&#8217; said Loftus, who had vain hopes
of converting him, &#8216;of great credit among his countrymen,
and upon whom, as touching causes of religion, they wholly
depend.&#8217; But Walsh could hardly live safely in Ireland, and
he died in Spain in 1578, having for some time acted as
suffragan to the Archbishop of Toledo. Hugh Brady, appointed
by patent in 1563, was a purely Protestant bishop.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

Meiler
Magrath.</div>

<p>At the accession of Elizabeth, Raymond MacMahon was
Bishop of Clogher. He died in 1560 probably, and it is not
pretended that he conformed. There is a regular Papal succession
from his death, but the Queen made no appointment
till 1570, when she preferred the notorious Meiler Magrath.
Eugene Magennis was Bishop of Down and Connor, and perhaps
made some show of conformity, for he was present in
the Parliament of 1560. He died in 1563, and Shane
O&#8217;Neill tried to get the see for his brother, who was only
twenty-three years old. The Pope refused, and in 1565
Meiler Magrath was appointed at Rome. Magrath, who was
utterly unscrupulous, made all the official submissions required
of him, and in 1580 was deprived by the Pope &#8216;for
the crime of heresy and many other enormities.&#8217; From that
date there is a regular Papal succession. Magrath, who had
been originally a Franciscan friar, became the Queen&#8217;s Archbishop
of Cashel in 1570; her Majesty having previously
appointed John Merriman to Down and Connor. Magrath
therefore enjoys the unique distinction of having been Protestant
Archbishop of Cashel and Papal Bishop of Down and
Connor at one and the same time. He was no ornament
to either Church.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>Eugene O&#8217;Dogherty was Bishop of Derry at Elizabeth&#8217;s
accession. He was appointed by provision, and there is a
regular Papal succession from him, but it does not appear
that the Queen ever interfered. The same may be said of
Raphoe and Dromore. Peter Wall, a Dominican, became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Bishop of Clonmacnoise in 1556. On his death, in 1568, the
see was united to Meath by Act of Parliament, and the Popes
made no appointment until 1647. Patrick MacMahon was
Bishop of Armagh from 1541 to 1568 at least, in which
latter year he appears to have been deprived by bull. He
died before November 1572, and in 1576 the Pope provided
a successor as from his death and not from his deprivation,
which may cast some doubt on the above-mentioned document.
The Queen made no appointment till 1583. Kilmore
was vacant at her accession, and she made no appointment
till 1585. There is, however, a regular Papal succession.
As a plain matter of fact the Government had no ecclesiastical
jurisdiction in Ulster during the early part of Elizabeth&#8217;s
reign. It was different with Meath, and Bishop Brady has
the credit of restoring the ruined church of Kells in 1578.
That it should have been then in ruins says little for the
position of religion where the State had power.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dublin.</div>

<p>A sentiment attaches to Armagh, but Dublin was much
more really important. It was beyond Shane O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s power
to burn either St. Patrick&#8217;s or Christ Church, and a Papal
nominee could hardly venture into the city or even into the
diocese. Hugh Curwen, who was Archbishop from 1555 to
1568, when he was translated to Oxford, undoubtedly conformed,
and it is through him that Irish Protestant bishops
derive what is called apostolical succession. The Pope did
not make even a titular appointment until 1600. Thomas
Leverous, Kildare&#8217;s old tutor, and a most excellent man, was
Bishop of Kildare at Mary&#8217;s death, was deprived in 1559, so
far as the Government could deprive him, for refusing to take
the oath of supremacy, and supported himself as a schoolmaster
till his death in 1577. He was buried at Naas, within his
own diocese, and his body was said to have performed many
miracles. The Popes made no appointment until 1629, and
the history of the Protestant see is very curious.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>Alexander Craik, a Scot, was appointed by patent in
1560, and was allowed to hold the Deanery of St. Patric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>k&#8217;s
also. He is accused of impairing his bishopric by alienating
the lands, but he was in the direst poverty, and he evidently
had a conscience, so perhaps this may be calumny. &#8216;Neither,&#8217;
he wrote to Leicester, &#8216;I can preach to the people nor the
people understand me.&#8217; Loftus was his chaplain and only
ally, and he begged to be released. His deanery of St.
Patrick&#8217;s was valueless to him, for William Basnet claimed to
hold it by a lease of Henry VIII. Nevertheless the Crown
pressed him for first-fruits, and he had not wherewithal to
pay the bare expenses of his removal to Ireland. As a
preacher he was overworked, and when he imported an
assistant from Hampshire, the Bishop of Winchester cited the
latter for non-residence. Both for the sake of his health and
his pocket he begged leave to visit England, but apparently
the request was refused, and in 1563 he was actually in
prison for 632<i>l.</i> due on account of first-fruits which he had
not the means to pay. He died in the following year, and
the see was given, unsolicited, to Robert Daly, a Prebendary
of St. Patrick&#8217;s, whose power of preaching in the Irish
language recommended him to the Queen. The net value of
his bishopric not being more than 50<i>l.</i> a year, Daly was
allowed to retain his prebend as well as the vicarage of
Swords. He was a sincere and energetic Calvinist, and in
1565 he wrote to Cecil lamenting the measures taken against
the Puritans. &#8216;The poor Protestants,&#8217; he said, &#8216;being
amazed at the talk doth oft resort towards me to learn what
the matter means: whom I do comfort with the most fruitful
texts of Scripture that I can find, willing them to put their
trust in God, who promised that the faith should not decay
in His elect, and never to leave His flock comfortless.&#8217; We
have here the germ of many future troubles. Irish Protestantism,
being the religion of a minority in a Roman Catholic
country, naturally took a Calvinistic hue, and the attempt to
make it conform to the views of Parker, Whitgift, Laud, and
others destroyed any chance which the State Church might
have had. Daly begged for such encouragement as would
enable him not only to comfort his friends, but to &#8216;suppress
the stout brags of the sturdy and proud Papists.&#8217; He re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>mained
Bishop of Kildare for eighteen years, during which
he was turned out of house and home three times by the
rebels. The last outrage was in 1582, and is supposed to
have caused his death.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ossory.</div>

<p>The see of Ossory, which it was in Ormonde&#8217;s power to
protect, would naturally have been one in which the State
religion might have had a fair chance. John Thonery was in
possession at Mary&#8217;s death, and Bale was also alive. The
Kilkenny historian says the Protestant Bishops derive their
succession through Thonery, but there is a difficulty about
this, for an official document written in 1565 declares the
see to have been long vacant, and another paper written
while Bale was still alive also treats it as vacant. Now Bale
died in 1563, and Thonery certainly not before 1565.
Thonery was employed by the Government in 1559, and there
is some evidence that he was considered still Bishop in 1567.
But the Queen appointed Christopher Gafney towards the end
of 1565. From these rather contradictory data it may perhaps
be inferred that Thonery never conformed, but that he was
not formally deprived. Probably he left the country, for he
was certainly considered the true Bishop at Rome. The
consistorial act nominating Thomas Strong in 1582 declares
the see to have been many years vacant, since the death of
Thonery, the last Bishop. Strong made his way to Ireland in
1584, but found his position untenable, and died in Spain in
1602, having long acted as suffragan to the Bishop of Compostella.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Leighlin.</div>

<p>Thomas O&#8217;Fihily, or Field, was Bishop of Leighlin at
Elizabeth&#8217;s accession, and undoubtedly conformed, fully abjuring
the Pope&#8217;s authority. He died in 1566, and was
buried in his own cathedral. Here, therefore, is an undoubted
link between the Marian and Elizabethan Churches.
Alexander Devereux, who was made Bishop of Ferns in
1539, and consecrated by Browne, managed to hold his see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
through the remainder of Henry&#8217;s reign, and through the
reigns of Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, till his death in 1566.
He is acknowledged both in the Papal and Protestant successions,
but was a man of indifferent character and no credit
to either Church.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cashel.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rival Archbishops.</div>

<p>Roland Baron was made Archbishop of Cashel by Mary,
and held the see till his death in 1561. But this case does
not affect the succession, for Baron, on account of some informality
perhaps, was never acknowledged at Rome. In 1567
rival archbishops were appointed. The Queen&#8217;s nominee was
James MacCaghwell, an Irishman, whose learning and virtue
had recommended him to Jewel. Jewel handed him on to
Loftus, who advised that he should have Cashel, &#8216;the living
being very small and not meet for any but of that country
birth.&#8217; The Primate evidently thought all fat things should
be reserved for Englishmen like himself. The still poorer
diocese of Emly was added during MacCaghwell&#8217;s episcopate;
but he had little enjoyment of either see. Maurice Reagh
FitzGibbon was appointed by the Pope, and in some way
violently dispossessed the Queen&#8217;s man. Hooker says he
wounded him with a knife, but if that happened it was more
probably the act of some kerne. MacCaghwell seems, however,
to have been closely imprisoned, so that his whereabouts
became doubtful. Primate Lancaster said that FitzGibbon
had carried his rival into Spain. For a time at least FitzGibbon
got possession of the cathedral, and is said to have
forced his rival to remain in the choir while he celebrated
mass. The rough treatment to which MacCaghwell was subjected
may have shortened his life. At all events he died
in 1570, and Meiler Magrath was appointed in his place.
FitzGibbon&#8217;s triumph was shortlived, for he did not venture
to visit his diocese. From 1569 to 1578, he seems to have
remained on the Continent defying Walsingham&#8217;s schemes to
entrap him, and it is doubtful if he ever returned to Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Waterford
and
Lismore.</div>

<p>The sees of Waterford and Lismore were united in the
fourteenth century. Patrick Walsh, an Oxford graduate, who
had been Dean of Waterford since 1547, was appointed in
1551 by <i>congé d&#8217;élire</i>, followed by capitular election, and
remained in possession during the reign of Mary. The probability
is that he was at first a waverer whose English
education induced him to conform to Henry VIII.&#8217;s arrangements,
and that he gradually reverted to Rome. When
Sussex entered Waterford in 1558 the Bishop received him
in his robes, but the Protestant ritual had not yet been re-established.
Walsh resigned his deanery in 1566 in favour
of Peter White, who was a very good man but certainly no
Protestant. The Bishop retained his place in both successions,
but when he died in 1578, Waterford, in the opinion of
English Protestants, was thoroughly given up to &#8216;superstition
and idolatry,&#8217; to &#8216;Rome runners and friars;&#8217; and so it remained
during the whole of Elizabeth&#8217;s reign. Walsh&#8217;s Protestant
successor, Marmaduke Middleton, only sat some three
years, and was practically expelled by the hostility of his
flock. He was translated to St. David&#8217;s, and the diocese then
fell for several years into the all-devouring maw of Meiler
Magrath. The Popes made no appointment till 1629.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>Cork and Cloyne were united in the fifteenth century, and
Dominic Tirrey was appointed in 1536. He held possession
of the see for twenty years, but was never acknowledged at
Rome, and there is a double succession from the year 1540.
The remote see of Ross does not appear to have been filled
either by Henry VIII., Edward VI., or Mary. Papal appointments
were made in 1519, 1526, 1554, 1559, and 1561. In
1582 William Lyon was appointed by patent, and soon afterwards
received Cork and Cloyne also. The three sees have
since been united in the Protestant succession, but the Papal
see of Ross has continued separate, though no appointment
appears to have been made between 1582 and 1647.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>William Casey, who was undoubtedly a Protestant, was
appointed Bishop of Limerick in 1551. He was deprived
by Mary, but restored by Elizabeth in 1571. Between 1556
and 1571 the see was held by Hugh Lacy, who was not a
Protestant, though he seems to have been something of a
trimmer. Yet he made no attempt at concealment when
Sidney visited his cathedral in 1568. Lacy cannot be held
to have conformed, for when the temporalities were restored
to Casey he continued to act as Papal Bishop till his death in
1580, not long before which he suffered a short detention in
his own house. There is a regular double succession from
1571.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>James Fitzmaurice, Cistercian Abbot of Odorney, was
made Bishop of Ardfert and Aghadoe by the Pope in 1536.
Queen Elizabeth made no appointment till 1588, some years
after Fitzmaurice&#8217;s death. Her nominee was unable to hold
his ground in Kerry, nor was the Papal Bishop permanently
resident. The facts about Killaloe are not very clear. From
a comparison of dates it would appear that Bishop James
O&#8217;Corren, who took the oath of supremacy in 1539, was deprived
or suspended at Rome, that he afterwards resigned,
that the see was for a time governed by vicars, and that Terence
O&#8217;Brien was made Bishop by the Pope in 1554. Bishop
O&#8217;Brien died in 1569, and the Government seems not to have
interfered with him. The temporalities were soon afterwards
handed over to Maurice MacBrien Arra, who, on account of
his youth, was not consecrated till 1576. In the meantime
the Pope had appointed Malachy O&#8217;Molony. MacBrien was
educated at Cambridge, and doubtless conformed, as he remained
Bishop till 1612. Being chief as well as pastor, he
had a better chance of success than most of Elizabeth&#8217;s men,
but he had trouble with his Papal rivals, O&#8217;Molony and
O&#8217;Mulrian, the latter of whom was appointed in 1576.
O&#8217;Mulrian, who was a sharp thorn in the side of Government
during the Desmond rebellion, died in Portugal in 1616,
having been an exile for many years. John O&#8217;Nialain,
appointed by Papal provision, was Bishop of Kilfenora from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
1541 till his death in 1572. The Popes made no fresh

made any at all.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Tuam.

<p>Christopher Bodkin was Archbishop of Tuam at Elizabeth&#8217;s
accession. He was on fairly good terms with the
Government, but there seems no reason to suppose that he
turned Protestant in any real sense. As he sat uninterruptedly
from 1536 to 1572, we may not uncharitably suppose
him to have had rather an elastic conscience. After his
death the two successions are separate. Redmund O&#8217;Gallagher
was Bishop of Killala from 1549 to 1569, from which latter
date the successions are separate. O&#8217;Gallagher was not at
any time a Protestant. Kilmacduagh was held by Bodkin
with Tuam, after which Stephen Kirwan was appointed by
the Queen and Dermot O&#8217;Diera by the Pope. Elizabeth
never made any appointment to Achonry, which may be considered
purely Papal during her reign. The see of Elphin
was held along with Clonfert till 1580, when Thomas Chester,
an Englishman, was appointed by the Queen. The Papal
succession is altogether separate. The local influence of
Roland de Burgo enabled him to keep possession of Clonfert
from 1534 till his death in 1580. He conformed so far as to
take the oath of allegiance in 1561, but he was not a Protestant.
The successions separate after his death. On the whole
it may be said that Queen Elizabeth scarcely interfered in
Church matters in Connaught; at least towards the end of
her reign.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>Lists have been preserved of three archbishops and
seventeen bishops &#8216;in a certain Parliament&#8217; held in 1560, and
of four archbishops and twenty-two bishops &#8216;answerable to
the Parliament in Ireland, and summoned unto the Parliament
holden in 1585.&#8217; It has been assumed by some writers
that all the prelates mentioned in the first list actually attended
Parliament; whereas it is much more probable that many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
were only summoned, as is expressly stated in the second list.
The mere fact of certain sees being named in any such list is
no proof that the incumbents conformed to Elizabeth&#8217;s arrangements.
Some of the bishops, even if present, may have
voted against the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity. The
position of the twenty dioceses mentioned in the list may be
briefly summarised thus:&mdash;One archbishop, Curwen of Dublin,
conformed. Christopher Bodkin of Tuam may, from his
character, have conformed insincerely, but this is not proved.
Baron of Cashel had never been confirmed by the Pope, so
that his case does not count, though there is no proof of his
having conformed. Walsh of Meath and Leverous of Kildare
were deprived. O&#8217;Fihily of Leighlin conformed. In the remaining
cases, the evidence is not very distinct as to formal
conformity or the reverse, but many can be proved to have
been Roman Catholics, and none can be proved to have been
Protestants. No doubt some bishops took the oath of
allegiance at the beginning of Elizabeth&#8217;s reign who could
not have done so after her excommunication. Some had
already acknowledged the supremacy of Henry VIII., in
which they were countenanced by Gardiner himself. The
fact that no Christian name is assigned to the Bishops of
Emly, Ross, Killaloe, Achonry, Killala, Ardfert, and Ardagh,
tends to prove that many of the sees given in the list were not
really represented. The Dublin officials knew something
about the Leinster, and a few of the Munster bishops; of the
more distant sees they knew no more than the bare names.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>The state of the Irish Church during the early years of
Elizabeth was as lamentable as it is possible to conceive.
A report made in 1566 by the Irish Council to the Privy
Council says that Curwen of Dublin, Loftus of Armagh, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
Brady of Meath did their best, both in preaching and in
looking after their clergy. &#8216;Howbeit,&#8217; they continue, &#8216;the
work goeth slowly forward within their said three dioceses by
reason of the former errors and superstitions inveterated and
leavened in the people&#8217;s hearts; and in want of livings sufficient
for fit entertainment of well chosen and learned curates
amongst them, for that those livings of cure being most part
appropriated benefices in the Queen&#8217;s Majesty&#8217;s possession,
are letten by leases unto farmers with allowance or reservation
of very small stipends or entertainments for the vicars
or curates, besides the decay of the chancels, and also of the
churches universally in ruin, and some wholly down. And
out of their said dioceses, the remote parts of Munster, Connaught,
and other the Irish countries and borders thereof
(saving the commissioners for the ecclesiastical causes have
travelled with some of the bishops and others, their ministers
residing in the civil and nearer parts), order cannot yet so
well be taken with the residue until the countries be first
brought into more civil and dutiful obedience. I, the Deputy
(Sidney), have given charge to the said bishops to make
diligent search, and to certify me in the next term, of every
the said decayed chancels and churches in their dioceses,
&amp;c.... The livings of the prebendaries of St. Patrick&#8217;s are
most part in benefices with cure, and they for the most part
aged men who, with the rest of the ministers of that College,
according the rules of the same, give their due attendance on
that collegiate church, daily doing divine service, and devotion
with due reverence and harmony convenient, and some
of them do preach also. Nevertheless, they have been treated
with by us the Archbishops of Dublin and Armagh, and Bishop
of Meath, and are found conformable to depart with such
portion of their livings as shall be thought fit by her Highness
for the setting forth and maintenance of learning and teaching
for this realm.... We know not as yet of any alienations
or wastes suffered to be made by the clergy, nor of any
appropriations of benefices by them put in use, nor that the
clergy of this realm are greatly inclined to offend in that part,
except the alienations or wastes done by the Bishop of Ferns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">The
Jesuit,
David
Wolfe.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the Popes were busily countermining. The
Jesuit, David Wolfe, a Limerick man who had spent several
years at Rome, was selected by Pius IV. for the Irish service.
The Pope wished to make Wolfe a bishop, and to invest him
with all the pomp proper to a nuncio. Lainez, who had recommended
Wolfe, opposed this, lest the humility of the
society should be offended, and lest the Papal insignia should
make the envoy&#8217;s work harder. The General&#8217;s advice was
taken, and Wolfe started for Ireland with the full power of
a nuncio, but without noise or show. After having been arrested
in France as a Lutheran, he reached Cork in January
1561. All his luggage had been lost at sea, and he found it
difficult to obtain bare subsistence, being unwilling either to
incur obligations or to beg. He managed, however, to maintain
himself for several years in Connaught and Western
Munster. In 1563 he issued a commission to Thady Newman,
a Dublin priest, giving him power to grant absolution &#8216;to all
and singular persons, both lay and ecclesiastical, and of either
sex, in all cases even if grave and enormous, and specially
from the crimes of heresy and schism, and to reconcile them
to mother church on doing penance, and making a public or
private abjuration.&#8217; Wolfe, who wrote from Limerick, says
the danger of the journey would not suffer him to visit
Leinster. He reported among other things that Tuam
Cathedral had been used as a fortress for 300 years, during
which time mass had not been said there; and that Archbishop
Bodkin had restored it to its proper use. There were
only twenty or thirty houses in Tuam. Ardagh Cathedral
was also used as a fort and in lay hands. About 1566 Wolfe
fell into the power of the Government, and was confined in
Dublin Castle. A bishop, probably Leverous, visited him
there, and was driven away by the stench. In 1572 or 1573
Wolfe made his escape, perhaps by means of money sent from
Spain, to which country he fled. The Protestant Bishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
Cork says &#8216;he foreswore himself,&#8217; whence it seems probable
that the severity of his confinement had been relaxed. Wolfe
returned to Ireland with James Fitzmaurice. Perhaps he
did as much as any one man to preserve the Papal power in
Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

Creagh&#8217;s escapes miraculous, but admits that he was on parole not to leave
the Tower. This may account in some degree for the severity with which
he was afterwards treated. See also a story, which may be apocryphal, in
<i>O&#8217;Sullivan Beare</i>, tom. ii. lib. iv. cap. 10.</p></div>
